[19:38] Holy Moly Media is No More
Answer: >> Holy moly media appears to have went out of business. Do you know of a replacement? >> Oh boy. Uh, this is actually not I didn't only get this question from one person. I've gotten this question from several people. And for those of you who don't know what Holy Moly Media is, a we got a a a super chat from Michael. That was very nice. Um, >> we'll look at it. >> Holy moly media was a company that sold movies that had been edited for content. So, all the bad language, all of the any if there were any nude scenes or anything like that, it cut all that out. and anything that was ultraviolent or anything. So much so that we have we have Die Hard from Holio Media and and my kids have seen it because it it it take took out all the all the stuff that was that that that you wouldn't want your kids to hear or see. Yeah, it's only about 30 minutes long, but we love it. >> Um it's funny because >> that's the way that I actually >> that was the way I was introduced to most movies when I was a kid. I didn't we didn't we didn't get most of our movies on VHS or on CDs or DVDs. Most of our movies came through Saturday afternoon television. And when something was played on network television, it was edited for TV. It had the bad words taken out. Any nudity taken out, ultraviolent stuff was taken out. That was how movies were made for television. It was and it said it says this movie has been edited for television. And now you can't get that anymore. You can't watch movies because nobody has cable anymore. Nobody has network television. Everybody has Netflix and all the other streaming services. So, Holy Moly Media was a company that provided edited versions like you would get on television. Unfortunately, they have gone out of business and I advertised for them. I had them I had a whole video I made about them because I really loved their product. But it is no more. So, the question is, is there a replacement? As of right now, I know not of any replacements for Holy Milly Media. The closest thing you're going to get is Vid Angel, and it's Vid Angel's got a lot of problems. I I Vid Angel has very a lot of limits on what it is able to to to do. Uh because it can only do certain movies, it can only do certain uh streaming services. So, Vid Angel is not a great option. We had it for a while, but we we let it go because we we just didn't use it. >> So, as of right now, my answer is no. As of as of right now, I'm bummed because I can't point you to a better resource. But, as soon as one comes available that I know about that I find out about, I will get it to you. And if anybody out there if anybody out there knows of a better resource, something like Holy Moly Media, and here's my here's my challenge. Maybe we should all write letters to the movie companies because if the movie companies would produce the clean versions like they did for television, the the made for TV versions, I would buy them. If it was available from Universal Pictures or Paramount or one of these other companies, if they had the movies available and it wouldn't take them a minute to edit the movie out, they did it for the the for the network showing. For me, it would be the most awesome thing and I would be happy to pay Paramount or Universal, whoever was the parent company to do that, but unfortunately, as of right now, it's not available. >> Uh, Clear Play does filters for movies. That That is one I have heard of, and I'm Thank you. Thank you for reminding me of that. Solomon, >> uh, we'll just put it up on the screen. Everybody else can guess how to say that. Um, Clear Play does filters for movies, but I've never I've never tried it, so I can't I can't endorse it. But I will I'll put a note here for Clear Play, and we'll we'll give that a look, and if it turns out to be good, we'll uh we'll endorse it. All right, that is it for question number one. Jennifer, let's move on to question number two. 23:45.
--------------------------------------------------
[23:45] Can you be a member of a church “online”?
Answer: >> Okay. Greetings, Brother Keith. I attend your Sunday service via YouTube every week. I live in Klay County, Alabama. I was wondering if it's okay to attend your online sermons and be consider considered part of y'all's wonderful congregation. I do sometimes attend a local congregation and have looked at a few more, but reformed seems to be a unheard of. In closing, in closing, I want to hear the word, not the world. Thank you for your time, and SGFC is in my prayers. Well, first of all, I want to say that I am I'm I'm glad that our church is ministering to you online, but this this this is important and I really want to be as as as forthright as I can. There there's no way for you to be a functioning part of our body when you live literally on the other side of the United States. You you you are, didn't they say California, Klay County, California, Alabama or or Alabama still? you're several states away. I I I know that it can be it can it can it can be nice to to to have good solid theology coming to you through the internet, but that doesn't make the experience you're having what what you should be having on the Lord's day in a local church. So, I want to pray that God will will lead you to a local church in your area. And and and I and I just want to say again, you cannot be a member of a church that you're not able to be a part of. Because part of membership in a church is not just listening to the sermons and enjoying the service. But part of membership in a church is that God gives you spiritual gifts to use within the body. And God gives other people spiritual gifts to use within the body. And those spiritual gifts work together in building up the body. And right now, you're not able to be a part of our body. As much as it might feel like you're a part because you're able to watch online, you're not able to really be a part. And as much as we appreciate you and as much as we love you, you're you're not able to really join the church that way. That's not the way it can function. And so I just want to say to you, one, I'm thankful that the ministry has been a blessing to you, but please don't consider an online ministry to be your church. It's I it's it's it's supposed to supplement what you're getting from a local church. It's not supposed to be a replacement for your local church. So, I pray that God would open the door for you to find a local church in your area. Know that we appreciate you. We we appreciate your prayers and we do appreciate you watching, but just don't let what we're providing through the internet to be something that replaces a local church. That's just not healthy for you, especially um in the long in the long run. It just wouldn't be good for your soul. And I care about your soul enough to tell you that it's just not good for you to to replace the local body with an online church experience. Uh and and and again, we're going to pray for you that God will help you find a local church. All right. Uh thank you again for sending that in. Let's move on, Jennifer. I'm trying to we got quite a few to get to tonight. So, moving moving along. We're now to question number three. >> Someone said in the comments, "Move to Callahan, Florida." And that would solve the >> Yeah. Yeah. Now, again, you're only in Alabama. I thought you're in California. I misheard. Uh you're in Alabama. That's about 12 hours away. move over to Jacksonville. Actually, don't do that. Don't do that. I mean, not that we would wouldn't want to have you, but moving moving for a church can also be bad because we we we might not be all that you think that we are. That's that that's another thing. I've had people who who've, you know, oh, I'd love to be a part of your church and then come find out that we're just a we're church. We're just a regular church. I mean, we have problems. We have issues. We're not perfect. So, uh that that definitely happens. Real quick, >> Ether, your beard is amazing. Any tips on beard grooming and maintenance? >> Oh, that is that is that really? Okay, first of all, Jedi, you make me feel good because I I was real close to trimming it way short today. >> I've been so hot and so tired from or working on the I said exercising. No, working on the my exercising is running that skill saw, baby. >> You were doing a lot of exercising. >> I've been up and down a lot. But no, uh uh my beard my beard maintenance routine is I wash my beard with the same stuff I wash my hair with and I brush it with a brush. That's all that's I don't I don't have a I don't have a routine. I just happen to be a hairy fellow. And so here's what I do. I use my hairbrush to brush. >> And then we see >> my beard. >> Where's my hairbrush? >> Oh, where is my hairbrush? Oh, where is my hairbrush? Oh well, well, you know, the guy who does Veggie Tales has turned out to be kind of a weird guy. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Phil Viser, is that his name? >> He's like all all woke now. I don't like that at all. >> All right. Somebody say something about the Harbor Freight bucket behind me if anybody hasn't noticed it. Harbor Freight right there. That's that's all the stuff that's going to our our first prize winner. I haven't got a chance to get it to him yet, but I am. All right. Uh We We need to change the time because we got off on the on the beard thing. Let's Let's go now. It is 2920.
--------------------------------------------------
[29:20] What distinguishes a lesson from a sermon?
Answer: >> Squirrel. >> Squirrel. >> Go ahead, Jennifer. >> Ask the question >> all over the place. >> Okay. Pastor Keith, thank you first of all for taking the time to answer these questions. My elders have asked me several times to lead the Bible study during our Wednesday night prayer meeting and Bible study. As a lay member of the church, I've been hesitant to call the lessons I've delivered from the pulpit on Wednesday nights sermons. My question is, what distinguishes a lesson from a sermon? Am I drawing a distinction where there really isn't one? Is my hesitancy to call it a sermon unfounded? >> Okay, this is a great question, and this is actually one that there's some debate over. So I want to I want to be I want to I want to be open enough to say that my answer may be different from the way other people may answer this. Uh but all I can do is give you what I think. People say is there a difference between a lesson and a sermon? Yes. What is the difference between a lesson and a sermon? Well a lesson is about about imparting information. It's about teaching you something you didn't know. There there's there there's something in a sermon that is what we call the sermonic thesis or the the uh and now uh uh part of the sermon. You know, now that you've learned this and now we should we should respond in some way. A lesson doesn't necessarily call for a response, but a sermon should call for some kind of response. Even if the response is to um to recognize your God and worship him, right? That that that should call for a response. Or if the if the response, it's not always like a gospel response like turn from your sin and trust in Jesus. But the the the the gospel is part of the message, right? Trust in Christ is is is should be coming out in our sermons. Trust in Christ and believe his gospel, right? That should be part of our sermon. And that's not always part of a lesson. I can give a lesson on the history of textual variation in the New Testament Greek manuscript tradition, right? And and I could give an entire lesson on that without there ever being an and now moment or so what moment, right? But that's why that would not ever be a sermon. Now, now in my sermon, I might talk about textual variation. And I have like in my sermons, in fact, in just a few weeks, I'm going to be in John 8 and I'm going to be talking about John 7:53-811, which is one of the major textual variants of the New Testament. And I'm going to have to include that in my sermon. But that's going to result in an and now moment, right? There's going to be somewhere in the sermon where I say, "Now that you have heard this and now we we respond, right? A response moment." So, so that's one of the things I think we need to consider is when we when we talk about what distinguishes a sermon from a lesson, a lesson doesn't have to have a call of response, but a sermon should a sermon should not end with just when there's the facts. Do with them what you want, right? No, there should be. And and here is what God wants us to do with this. Here's what God is calling us to do as a result of this. So, that that's that's part of it. The other part of it is um when you are when you're when you're teaching or you're preaching they are going to flow together. So when people say is preaching teaching or is teaching preaching all preaching should have an element of teaching and um but not all teaching necessarily is going to be preaching that again goes back to the call on response. So, it really depends if if if there's no reason why a layman can't preach a sermon. You said you're a layman in the church and you're wondering if you are if if if if what you're doing on Wednesday nights from the pulpit should be called sermons. My answer is if you're preaching from the pulpit on a Wednesday night and it's a service, it's a sermon. And and and if it's a sermon, it should have some kind of a call to respond. And that would be the distinction. If you're just teaching a lesson like on the history of the the the the a certain doctrine or something, it may just be a lesson, but at the same time like on Wednesday nights, I teach lessons. I don't really do sermons as much on Wednesday nights, but there there's still even within that there's still preaching that happens. So, there's a lot of bleed over. There's a lot of there's a lot of there's a lot of uh there's just a lot that that that that that is is united between both of those. So, um but I don't think you I don't think you should have any fear of calling what you do a sermon because if you're up behind the pulpit preaching or speaking from God's word to God's people, you're explaining the text. Here's all a sermon is by the way. you you uh you read the text, you explain the text, you apply the text. That's what a sermon is. If you're doing that, that's that's a sermon. That's a sermon. And and again, it comes back to that application. And so what and now um somebody said, "Call it a sermonet." Yeah. All right. Um okay, let's uh that great question. Let's move on. The next one is a historical question. I think it's a great one. Let's go ahead and move on to the next question. 3440. And then can we talk about Metropolis, Illinois? This is what we've been talking about in the comments. >> Well, we can stop right now. I'll mark out that number and we'll come back to a second. I know I'm wearing a Superman shirt and somebody Go ahead, read. >> I explained them. If Keith wants to meet the real Superman in Metropolis, that would be Brother Jack Russell, my pastor growing up and mentor to one Paul Washer. >> That's awesome. >> But she lived in the city Metropolis, Illinois. Like the real museum there. >> Really? Well, that's I know there's a Superman museum. I I didn't know where it was, but that but that that's really cool. That's really cool. They have a big Superman festival in June. A Superman statue. Superman museum. I think we're going to go to where is it? Illinois. I think we're going to go to Illinois in June and and enjoy the Superman festival. That would be awesome. Uh, funny enough, I'll tell you a quick story. I I'm a Superman fan. You can tell, you can look up here, you'll see a bunch of Superman figurines. There's a there's a three-foot Superman statue over there. I am a Superman fan. >> But when I was a when I was a kid, I was a Superman nut. Like I I I collected comic books. Love the movies. I I can Yeah, I can quote all the Christopher Reeves movie. Chris Reeve is the greatest Superman of all time. Don't come at me. You won't win. Uh I know Henry Caval's beautiful. All you people, oh, look at Henry Caval. He's so handsome. He's so beautiful. And I say that with an unblenmished record of heterosexuality. He is a beautiful man, but he is not Christopher Reeves. Christopher Reeves is the greatest Superman ever. And again, don't come at me. I know what I'm I know what I'm about. So anyway, having said all that, when I was in probably uh 8th grade, my dad decided we were going to go to Washington DC. And while we were going to Washington DC, he told me we were going to visit the Smithsonian. And at the time, we thought there was a Superman exhibit in the Smithsonian. >> We walked all through the Smithsonian Museum. Never got to any Superman exhibit. So I was disappointed all of the amazing things that exist in the Smithsonian Museum. And I was disappointed because there was not a Superman exhibit in the Smithsonian. So, if there is a Superman exhibit in Metropolis, Illinois, I want to go because I was disappointed when I was a teenager. All right, guys. That's my thoughts. You ready to move on? >> Yes. >> Okay. You know, we got some really long questions later. Uh, I don't know how
--------------------------------------------------
[37:17] Is the belief in biblical inerrancy a modern idea?
Answer: much of we're going to read, but we'll get there. >> Okay. I read this claim in a social media post. I can't remember if they claimed that the idea of an erit seed didn't come around till the 19th or 20th century. >> Okay, this is one of those times where someone will claim something and there may be truth to the claim but the claim is is is arguing too much. Okay. So the claim is that inherency is a recent doctrine. Inherency is a recent doctrine. What is inherency? Inherency says that the Bible is without error in everything that it says. That's the doctrine of inherency. And people will say, well, that the ancient people understood that the Bible made mistakes when it came to the numbers of people or the people understood that the Bible made mistakes when it when it was when it when it said things about how many tribes did certain things or how many people were in certain tribes or these things or they were using round numbers and things like this. And the argument is that the doctrine of inherency is applying a a modern and even uh a a unnecessary rigidity on the text that forces it to say well to to to to be absolutely precise in everything that it says. And the argument goes that that's not the way that ancient writers would have would have written. That's not the way it would have been understood. So that's a modern imposition upon the text. I don't agree with that. I'm just saying that's sort of the that's the argument is that the is that inherency was not something that was argued about in the ancient world. That's not that it was it's it's a recent argument. And and here's again my answer. There is some truth to that in the sense that the term inherency is relatively recent and the and the idea of rigid or a rigid inherency is is relatively recent. But the Bible clearly proclaims that it speaks the truth. Jesus himself says, "Sanctify them by thy truth. Thy word is truth." Right? And so if you argue that the Bible has errors, what you're saying is that the Bible has falsehoods. And if you read through the church fathers and you read through the reformers and you read through all the people who lived prior to the 19th century, you'll find that they claim that the Bible speaks the truth. The Bible says the truth. And so to argue that inherency is a later doctrine. Well, the the the the term and the use of language may be a later developed idea. But the idea that the Bible speaks the truth and says what is true is not a recent idea. This is something that was held by Christians throughout the ages who have believed that the Bible and is true and what it says is true. Now there is something that we have to consider and this is why I believe the Chicago statement on biblical inherency is important because when we talk about biblical inherency we have to consider the fact that there are textual variations and there are manuscript discrepancies and things that that raise questions about certain portions of certain texts. But that doesn't mean that the Bible as it was written contained errors. But what it means is that through the centuries through scribal amendations and uh scribal errors and scribal uh changes there have been things that have been introduced into the text that now we have to look at and we actually have to evaluate the history of the text based on the evidence that we have from the manuscripts. But that's not the same as saying that the Bible is uh was written with errors. And this is why like in our statement of faith at our church, it says the Bible is inherent in its original autographs. Meaning the original writings when John sat down to write the gospel of John. The Bible says he was carried along by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit superintended the writing of scripture. Therefore, if the Holy Spirit is superintending the writing of scripture, then we can be confident that John got it right, that he actually wrote the truth. Now, are there again, are there places where there are textual variations which cause some issues? I I was listening to RC Sproul today and he was talking about how there's actually one manuscript somewhere that talks about Goliath not being 9 foot tall, but being 6 foot tall. And Goliath wouldn't have been uh very imposing if he was only my height, right? He wouldn't have been that frightening if he was only 6' tall. But that's a variation. That's not what we would say is part of the original manuscript. And so we don't have to consider that to be a viable variant. So these are all things that come in into the question of inherency. But if someone says that inherency is a modern idea, I would say the language that we use for rigid inherency probably is a modern a modern way of looking at it. But the church has always agreed when I say the church historically church fathers, middle u uh medieval church writers and into the post-reformationational church have all agreed that the what the Bible says is true. What the Bible says is true. And so that's that's where I hang my hat. I believe that what the Bible says is true. Could there be variance introduced through scribal errors and things throughout the the the centuries? Yes. And those have to be evaluated based upon the evidence. But it doesn't mean that I can't trust what my Bible says. So that's a simple answer, but I hopefully it's one that that is helpful. Um, when someone says inherency didn't come along until the 20th century or the 19th century, the language, yes, but not the concept. All right, let's move on to the next
--------------------------------------------------
[43:35] Can believers have godly sorrow and worldly sorrow?
Answer: question. >> Okay, >> I'm going to turn this heater off. It's hot. >> All right, Miss Jennifer, let's go. >> Referencing 2 Corinthians 7:10, can believers have godly sorrow and worldly sorrow? Like when you first sin, you're you're struck by worldly sorrow, then quickly recognize that and see that it's wrong, and then you're led to godly sorrow. Yeah. Um I preached through 2 Corinthians two years ago. Uh I I I think I spent 18 months in 2 Corinthians and I remember preaching this particular passage and I talked about the fact that uh worldly sorrow is experienced by everyone. Uh it's godly sorrow. It's God godly sorrow that leads to repentance. Your question is, can a believer have both? Yes. I think a believer can experience a form of worldly sorrow even though they're a believer because we're not completely sanctified. There are times when I don't have the sorrow I should have, the godly sorrow that leads to repentance because I'm still struggling with that particular sin in my life and I'm not uh yet fully repented of it. Right? And so, yes, I think the answer uh can a believer have worldly sorrow? Yes. And here's here's an example. Jennifer Jennifer counsels with me. We we actually do provide counseling at our church in different contexts. And a lot of times Jennifer will will will counsel along with me. She's trained as a counselor as well. And so, um, we have both experienced where we are counseling Christians and that Christian is dealing with a particular sin and yet they're not ready or willing to repent of that sin. They're still struggling in the sense of struggling with it, but they're really not because they're still engaging in it, right? they're still they're still loving that sin and and and so having to call them to repentance, having to call them to recognizing that sin. Uh is is part of what brothers and sisters are supposed to do when someone is, as Galatians says, if your brother's caught in a a transgression, you know, rebuke him, right? Go and and and restore him if he if he repents, right? But why do you have to rebuke him? Because he probably has not yet felt that godly sorrow, right? The rebuke is what helps bring about the godly sorrow hopefully, right? Maybe he feels the worldly sorrow, but it's not leading him to repentance. Godly sorrow leads to repentance. So yes, can a believer feel worldly sorrow and godly sorrow? Yes. But our prayer is that is that we would feel godly sorrow that leads to repentance whenever it we're engaged in any kind of sin. So So that's um I guess a simple answer to a to a pretty heavy question. That makes sense. >> Yeah. Yeah, I think we can probably move on from there. That that was a a good question. Uh not don't have a lot to add to it except that um if if if I were if I were dealing with someone, I might point that out to them. If someone came to me and and or or if I recognized someone was in sin and I called them out on it or rebuked them for it or I or I, you know, tried to counsel them on it and it and it was obvious they had some sorrow but no desire to change, I might say to them, you are you're you're demonstrating worldly sorrow, but godly sorrow leads to repentance. So, um so that's that that would be that that that would be something I would want to point out to them. In fact, I want to just real quick here since we're since we went through this one a little bit quickly. I want to I want to look at something real quick here. Jennifer, tell them that joke, you know. >> Oh, >> just kidding. We have a joke around the house. So, Jennifer does have great Yeah. Right here. Uh 2 Corinthians 7:10 says, "For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death." Yes. Um well in this case it's referring to someone who is unwilling to repent. They have worldly grief over their sin because sin always has consequences, right? But they don't repent. The believer repents, but can a believer experience worldly grief in that there there's a time where they're unwilling to repent? Yes, I think that that could be the case, but it might not be to the extent that Paul's referring to there in that passage. Uh so yes, I think it would still be a form of worldly grief until such time as they actually do uh repent of that sin. All right. Somebody says, "Tell us tell us what what did I miss? You watching the comments?" >> I I must have missed that. >> Okay. >> All right. >> Okay. >> All right. Let's move on. We uh we got plenty more questions. When in doubt, I should play paper rock scissors. Shoot.
--------------------------------------------------
[48:22] Does Amillennialism reject that the Great Tribulation happened in AD70?
Answer: >> That's right. >> That's from us. >> Yeah. Paper rock scissors. Everybody gets mad because I don't say rock paper scissors. It's paper rock scissors. >> Paper scissors. >> It's paper rock scissors. Paper comes first. >> Paper rock scissors. All right, Jennifer, let's go to next question, please. >> Love you guys. I'm a big fan of short and sweet questions. So, here goes. We're big fans of that, too. are believing that the great tribulation was in 70 AD and all millennialism mutually exclusive trying to work out this whole esquetology thing has me really wore out. >> All right, great question and I'll make this a simple answer. The answer is no. The they are not mutually exclusive. You can believe that the the the the belief that the great tribulation occurred in AD70 is uh known as part what's known as a predtoistic view of the great tribulation. And uh I'm what's known as a partial predtoist amillennialist which means that I believe that the et discourse at least much of the et discourse was looking forward to the destruction of the temple in AD70. Even though there are portions of the Olivet discourse that I think looked forward to the final second coming of Christ, I I believe there was a dual fulfillment that there was the immediate fulfillment of the the um destruction of the temple in AD70 and then of course that there was a uh there is coming a final fulfillment in the return of Jesus Christ at the end of the age. And so, uh, I if you're asking, can can an amalennialist believe that the the great tribulation occurred in AD70? Answer is yes, because I believe that, and I am the king of the Amalennials. So, yeah. In fact, I shouldn't I should have brought my crown. Jennifer bought me a crown for Christmas. It's beautiful. So, it says king of the Amalennials on it. Um, so yes, can a person believe that? I will say this, it's not the majority report among Amillennials. uh it tends to be more the position of the postmillennial crowd. Most of them hold to a partial predtoistic view. But this is where I'm sort of an odd duck is I'm a partial predtoist amalennialist. But yes, you can hold to amal millennialism doesn't demand that you hold a particular position on when the great tribulation takes place other than the fact that most amalists would say that there is tribulation all through the church age or all through the millennium which we are in right now. And I would agree with that. I would agree with it being a um an ongoing tribulation that the church experiences. The even the Lord Jesus Christ told us that you know in this world uh we're going to experience tribulation. Paul says in this world you have trouble or Jesus said in this world you have trouble but take heart I've overcome the world. So um those are th those are the some of the differences but in general we talk about the great tribulation. We're talking about uh what happened to Jerusalem in AD70. That that at least is the uh fulfillment I believe of much of the ET discourse. All right. So, uh let's move on to the next question. >> Okay. The context for this question.
--------------------------------------------------
[51:34] When does neglect of the Lord's Supper become sinful?
Answer: There is a church I'm familiar with that has only had to my memory the Lord's supper three times in 26 years. I'm not aware of a specific p passage that dictates how frequently we are to partake of the elements, but this seems to be sinful neglecting of the means of grace. The reasons given for why this was not common practice was fear and some would unworthy unworthily partake and that nothing in the Bible says how frequently we are to partake of the Lord's supper. Okay. So the question is when does neglect of the Lord's supper become sinful? When does neglect of the Lord's supper become sinful? Well, if your church has only done the Lord's supper three times in 26 years. >> Wow. >> Yeah. That's sinful. I I I I and I say that not I'm not pulling that out of thin air. I am telling you that while a case a case can be made that you don't have to do it every week. We do it every week. A case could be made that it's not required for every week. Even though I believe we should. I believe the model of the early church is to participate every week. But a case could be made that that's not required. But three times in 26 years means you have held back the Lord's supper. The very picture of the gospel, the very means by which Christ demonstrates his sacrifice before the people of God, the bread and the cup. You have you have had people come and go from your church and who have served and lived and loved there for years and never tasted of the bread or drank of the cup. In 26 years, if you've only done it three times, it's possible that that several people, dozens of people may have come and gone and not tasted of the Lord's supper at your church. Yeah, I would say that's wrong. I would say that's sinful. I would say that's sinful neglect. We I if your church had not sung worship songs to Jesus and to the Lord uh the triune God, if your if your church had not sung songs in 26 years, I would say that's wrong. I would say that's that's that's neglect of duty. If your if your pastor had not preached a sermon only three times in 26 years, I would say he was derelct in his duties. If your church had not administered baptism more than three times in 26 years, I would say unless unless there was some extenduating circumstance where there was just no one around to hear the gospel and be saved, I would say that was that that would be incredibly uh uh in inconsistent with what a church is supposed to be doing. So, yes, if you tell me your church has not taken communion but three times in 26 years, I have to say that's sinful. I have to say that's sinful. Um, and so how often should a church do it? We're not given an absolute. Jesus says, "As often as you do this, do this in remembrance of me." But we do know this. The early church met on the first day of the week. And they met for for according to Acts chapter 2. They met uh uh to uh for the apostles doctrine, for the for the fellowship, for the breaking of bread and for the prayers and and the breaking of bread is not just eating a meal together, but it was the language of the table. I believe the early church when they met they had the agape feast which was or sometimes referred to the agape feast or the agape feast the they had the the meal together and with that meal they took bread and they said this is this bread represents Christ's body this is my body they would pass it out this is my blood they would they would pass out the cup and they would eat it they would drink it in remembrance of what the Lord did and to not do that would have been odd to them it would have been uh something that was out of place to worship together and not have the Lord's supper. So, yeah, I think it's not good at all. Not good at all. >> Well, let me throw this up here real quick. Scott says, "Hey, Foskies, tell Stephanie congrats for putting up with me for 30 years as a >> Well, Scott, congratulations. And congratulations to you and your wife." 30 years. >> 30 years. >> Wow. They've got us by three years. This is Is this our 27th anniversary? Do we Did we just celebrate >> 25 26? We just did 26. >> No. >> 99. >> Okay. They got us by four years. >> Four years. >> Four years. All right. Well, congratulations, Scott. We are grateful to see a faithful husband and wife continuing to love each other. Three decades of marriage. Congratulations. And we're we'll never catch up, but we're right behind you. All right. All right. Uh, what, Keith? When is your BIR? What is that? >> What does that What does that mean? >> When is your beer? >> Birthday. Oh, I was like, when's your uh your birthday? My birthday is uh April the 2nd. >> You just missed April Fool's Day. Yeah. Yeah. Our daughter Ashley was March 31st. >> Yep. We we straddle April Fool's Day, so we always have fun on our birthdays. Ashley's March 31st and I'm April 2nd. >> Congratulations, Keith. Your wife has put up with you for 27 years. >> Actually, she's put up with me for 29 years. We met each other. Well, 20 28 years. We met each other on October 26, 1997 in Ryan Steakhouse on Merill Road in Jacksonville, Florida. I saw the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen wearing a red V-necked velvety shirt with a pair of blue jeans, white sneakers. She had her hair pulled back in a ponytail and uh and I remember looking at her brown eyes and she watched me do a magic trick for her and she thought it was pretty cool. And that was very surprising to me because no girl had ever thought I was cool up until that point. And uh I said, "I've got to I've got to grab hold of this one because she thinks I'm cool. And uh and it worked out. Yeah. >> All right, guys. Uh >> I missed Ryan Steakhouse. I would love Ryan Steakhouse. That would be that would be awesome. All right, let's uh let's do a couple more before we take a break. We we've got several. >> We're rolling. >> We are rolling. Uh we are at 5830.
--------------------------------------------------
[58:30] How do we respond to “Rapture Date” setters?
Answer: What's the best and loving response for us to give to those who are constantly setting rapture dates, particularly the ones who keep setting dates that come and go? Thump them in the forehead. No. Um, honestly, I don't hear this as much as I used to. I used to see this all the time. I mean, with Harold Camping, I did a sermon uh one time called Camping on Dangerous Ground. This was back when Herold Camping was really really out there making making bold claims about the return of Christ. And I just talked about the danger of his ministry and what because he he not only was he date setting but he was encouraging people to leave their churches and that the the uh the institutional church was dead and people needed to people need to leave the churches. They needed to listen to him because he was the voice of family radio and you need to listen to him and he would show you the way. And many people did and they followed many of his wild and very eccentric uh uh claims to knowing exactly when Jesus was going to return, knowing when the rapture was going to happen. And uh he was wrong and he ended up he ended up passing away. And he has to give an account for all the false prophets, all the false claims that he made and and and uh false state setting that he did. So, uh, the best and loving response for us to give those who are constantly setting rapture dates, ignore them. Tell them, "I'm not interested. This is you have no idea when Jesus is going to return. You are not going to make the claim and get it right. And I'm not concerned about your foolish ramblings. Just I I said this a while back. I said this actually I said this at Michael Foster's conference. Somebody said, "What do you what do we do with all these people, you know, online that are saying crazy things?" I said, "Don't feed the stupid." Right? Just don't feed the stupid. Don't give in to the stupid. Right? Just Just tell them, "I'm not interested. I'm not going to I'm not going to deal with this. I'm not I'm not giving you my attention. I'm not giving you my time." Um and as far as the people who sets the set dates, they come and go. Mock them. I mock them. This is this is one of those times where you you you're claiming you know when Jesus is going to return and you're wrong. And I make videos making fun of him because I this is one of those times where I feel like Elijah Mount Carmel when you you mock the the prophets of Baal, >> right? Uh but but the best the best thing and probably easiest thing you can do just ignore them and and don't let them bother you because they don't know. They the guys are well I did math and I came up with the 69 weeks and the and the and the the gap between the 69 and 70th week and we're about to enter Daniel's 70th week and blah blah blah. And it's like you are such a chatter head. You don't know. just hush and um just don't give them don't either don't give them your attention or uh mock them until your throat is sore. That's my recommendation. All right, let's uh let's move on. >> Okay, how much of this do you >> Okay, I forgot this is this is one of the we we got several long questions
--------------------------------------------------
[1:01:52] Does giving forgiveness mean we must continue to receive abuse?
Answer: this week and this is one of them and this one has some personal stuff in the question. So, um, maybe I should just explain it. >> Yeah. >> Because the question is, does giving forgiveness mean essentially that you have to continue to receive abuse? >> And the person wrote in and said, "Pastor Keith, forgiveness by God requires repentance. Even the change of heart is given by God. But we're required to forgive even those who don't when there is no repentance." I have some I have an issue with that, and I want to I want to bring that up, too. But we'll go back to that in a second. Um, but he goes on to basically say uh that that they're living with a family member who is not not physically or mentally abusive but just is very difficult to to deal with. This person has gotten older and as a result they are struggling with how to confront this person and should they confront them or just keep forgiving them? That's that's really the heart of the question. when you say is should they confront them or should they just keep forgiving them? >> And um but but but first I do want to address this thing because this was actually a big debate online a few weeks ago >> and I didn't engage with it because at the time I just didn't have the bandwidth to deal with it and I almost I thought about making a golf cart video about it and I might one day. Um maybe it'll be maybe I'll do one before the end of the year because yeah I've only got a day. >> Yeah. Um but the question of are you know this person says we are required to give forgiveness even if there's no repentance. I think you need to stop just short of that and I want you to think of this. Are we and and and and I know there's going to be controversy about this and I know some of you going to to argue. Some of you are even going to say Keith you're wrong. You're 100% wrong. and and and on this I think you need to listen and hear me before you automatically assume that what I'm saying is what you think I'm saying. If I were to say that we are required to forgive everyone who repents to us. I I think that's clear from scripture because Jesus says if if if your brother sins against you and he repents, you forgive him. If he sins against you seven times and comes to you and says I repent, you forgive him. We are we are commanded to to forgive everyone who repents. But if a person is unrepentive, if a person is unwilling to repent, are we required to forgive them? And here's where I think the issue rises with this. I think we're required to be ready to forgive them. I think we're required to stand ready to forgive them. But I think that forgiveness is transactional. meaning I think there for that person to receive forgiveness there has to be a a something on their part that receives it and that that is their coming and receiving that forgiveness and so if someone says well I forgave this person who hurt me okay well I think what you mean is that you stood you're standing ready to forgive them but until that person has repented until that person has come seeking reconciliation there's no real giving of the forgiveness because they're not receiving it yet right that's the point I'm making is is it's it's transactional. There there's there's something missing. Now, what you shouldn't do is you shouldn't be bitter and angry and holding back your willingness to forgive. But I think like the prodigal son, here's here's an example I'm going to give. The father of the prodigal son stood ready to forgive his son, right? He stood there waiting, looking for his son to come. And when his son came, he ran to him and he lavished him with forgiveness. He clothed him uh with the, you know, he put his garment on him. He put his ring on him. He gave him everything, right? Like he stood ready. But but the son had to come back, right? Jesus said if your if your brother sins against you and he returns and repents seven times, you you forgive him, right? So So the the point I'm making is is I I don't think forgiveness is completed without the other person's participation. I don't think I think I think we can stand ready to repent. I'm sorry, ready to forgive, but until there is action on the other person's part, um there there is I think it's it's not fully forgiven. There's not it's not fully completed. And so some people might say I'm splitting hairs there and say, "Well, we've forgiven them, but they haven't received the forgiveness." Okay, however you want to however you want to claim it. I'm just saying I remember one time RC Sproul talked about this because this was this was another aspect of it that I think is often overlooked. He said, he said, "Let's say a man steals your watch, right? And and and he comes to you and he says, "I'm I'm sorry for stealing your watch, but he's still wearing the watch and he's not going to give you the watch back." RC Sproul said, "That man's not forgiven because he's still wearing my watch, right?" Like like like like like he's still there like he's still doing it. Like the the transaction would be he takes the watch off and gives it back. But as long as he's wearing that watch, there's there's there's something missing here, right? there's something that this transactional loop hasn't closed, right? And so that that's that's kind of a a part that I think uh a a way that I think people miss um when we talk about can you forgive someone who doesn't repent. You can stand ready to forgive and you can offer forgiveness and you can tell them I forgive you, but until they receive it and I and they receive it through repentance and reconciliation, I think there's still an open loop that hasn't closed. That's that that's >> that's something that and and that's not really the question that you asked but it is something that I think needs to uh uh needs to needs to at least have been said. Um and so that that's that's a that's not answering your question but like I said that's part of of all this as far as your question. Um what what can you do? you you the main thing you asked in this and again I didn't read the whole thing because some of it's personal. I didn't read the whole thing because it's quite long. The main thing you asked is it wrong to stand up for yourself? And my answer is no. I do not think that you are required as a Christian to continue to receive mistreatment without at least stating the the the issue to the person who is mistreating you. Okay? And so if the person who is mistreating you, and I know who it is because I read the email, but I'm being a little bit vague. If the person who is mistreating you lives with you, and the person who mistreating you is a is is a is a family member, not a spouse, but another family member, and that person is mistreating you in a way that is certainly sinful and certainly wrong. I do not think that it's wrong for you to tell them that they are hurting you and to tell them that their actions are their actions are hurting your relationship. Now, based on what you wrote, it may not go very far. It may not do very much. It may not solve the problem. Jennifer, did you want to say anything about this? I know we talked in about this in the car. don't have to, but this was something that we discussed a little bit and I know >> I think also keeping just continually um you're dealing with an older person. I I can't I I was just thinking about my own experience with my dad is 83 and um he can say he's grieving and sometimes he can gives really short answers or he's very snippy or he you you know um and I just constantly try to try to just respond back in love and just let love cover a multitude of sins with him is the way but I I don't think to be abused I guess I I don't know does that make sense? Yeah. And I think what you just what you just said is something I did forget to mention. So I'm glad you you brought it up. And that is that the reality is we are called as Christians to hold short accounts to to not keep a record of wrongs. That's what love is according to 1 Corinthians 13. Right? Love is patient. Love is kind. It doesn't envy and doesn't boast. It doesn't keep a record of wrongs. Right? So when it comes to loving another person, love covers a multitude of sins. Right? Sometimes we do just move on, right? We just let it go. We we we do say, "I'm not going to hold this thing against you." But if it's got to the point where it's made you miserable, and that was the thing, I think with the email, it's made you miserable. You live in the house with the person, the person is mistreating you, and you're miserable, I think a conversation needs to be had. And you did say he's not like this always. So my counsel to you would be talk to him when he's not upset. talk to him when he's not upset and say, "Listen, um, I know there are times when you get upset and you make you make me feel really bad. You hurt me with your words and I love you and I don't want to feel the way that I feel, but sometimes I feel really upset with you. Sometimes I get really angry with you and I need you to help me by working this out and and let's try to work on this together and and let's have let's have a conversation about what's bringing this about. I mean, again, it may not it may not help, but at least you've you've taken your situation and you've tried to apply some some defense for yourself. not not offense to him, but defense for yourself to say, "Look, you're hurting me. You are you're hurting our relationship. You're hurting how I see you. I want to love you, and I want to treat you well, but you you don't treat me well often." And um and >> maybe that'll be the point where the person sees that. >> Maybe a light bulb will come on, you know, and and we pray that it would. Uh this is not an easy question. And we don't get easy questions, but this is one of the more hard questions because this is such a personal issue. We both have elderly parents. We both have, you know, we both have parents who, you know, struggle with with the with the difficulty of age. And so that's part of it, but you have to be honest. >> I know. On a side note, not really related to the question, but one time uh we were at the hospital with mom as she was passing away and my dad started yelling at my sister and she said, "Nope. Um, you know, I'm not 12 anymore. I'm not going to you're not going to talk to me that way. I'm an adult. You will not talk to me that way." He backed right down. Apolog saying those things. >> Yeah. >> I don't know. No, that I'm glad you told that story because that's really good. Sometimes sometimes it does require that you stand up for yourself. It's not sinful to tell a person that you don't want to be treated a certain way. That that's maybe that's the answer to the whole question. It's not sinful to be honest and say you the way you treat me makes me upset and it hurts me and if you love me, I don't want you to treat me this way because this isn't the way you should treat somebody that you love. Yeah. Uh, somebody asked if we have grandkids yet. The answer is no, but we are praying for them. We have a married daughter and Lord willing, uh, we'll get that call sooner rather than later. All right, let's move on to the next question, Jennifer. >> Okay. Hey, Pastor Keith. Blessed to be a
--------------------------------------------------
[1:13:35] Should you leave a church if you can no longer affirm their statement of faith?
Answer: witness to your ministry. Comedy is a market the enemy has cornered, so I'm glad we have you on our side. That being said, my question is this. If you attend a church but no longer can affirm the statement of faith, should you leave? I am a Baptist that attends a Baptist church, but my convictions and studies have led me to affirm a reformed Presbyterian view on baptism. Thank you, sir. >> Well, I just want to say I'm disappointed as a Baptist that you have abandoned ship uh running on after the popular Presbyterians right now. I wonder if it has anything to do with that guy online who keeps saying superior theology. I don't know. Could be. Uh my answer to you is uh you should be in a place where you're able to affirm everything that's taught and um yet at the same time if this is a newly a new conviction that has arisen in your heart and you're in a church that loves you and cares for you and ministers well to you and this isn't going to affect your ability to carry out a conviction. Uh it doesn't mean that you have to move automatically. Like for instance, if you had if you were a father of three and you were and they were all small children or infants and you wanted to baptize them and your church wouldn't let you baptize them because you're a Baptist or you're in a Baptist church, but you've got this conviction of a Presbyterian, then I would say, yeah, it might be time to move on. But if that's not where you are, then it then it might not be as urgent. Eventually though, you should probably find a church where you can live out your convictions. And that's why I believe domin denominations are good. I wrote an article about it just a few weeks ago, why I love denominations. you can see it at my Substack. Um, I think it's good that you can live out your own convictions in that area, even though I believe that you're wrong. So, my encouragement to you would be to say it's not urgent that you move on, but at the same time, I think eventually you probably should just I wouldn't I wouldn't make it I wouldn't make it a huge like I'm leaving because you don't believe everything I believe. I I would just say in your heart perhaps recognize that if this is where if there if this is where your convictions lie then at a certain point you probably want to be want to be in a place where you're able to express those convictions in agreement with other other believers. >> Can I mention this comment too? >> Yes. >> C Chap says talk to your pastor first. >> Oh great. Thank you. Very and and I almost always say that you don't leave a church without talking to your pastor. So thank you C Chaps for reminding me that. That is very good. Also, uh I saw Protesty was out there. Looks like they did a super chat. Always want to uh Let me say this. >> Best show on YouTube. Hey, the entire world. >> A thank you uh guys over at Protesty. Let me say this. I have so many of your videos logged because I've been working on the kitchen, remodeling our kitchen for the last two weeks, the last week and a half, and I really wanted to do a a church soup before the end of the year, but it's just not going to happen. and I just don't have time between now and January 1st >> uh to do a to do a church soup. I may have a denomination video come out this week, but I'll probably have to wait till next week to do a church soup. But it's going to be very protestcentric because I've got so many funny protest videos that got put out over the last couple weeks. So, thank you guys again for letting me letting me continue to use your your library videos. They are awesome. All right. Uh let's let's move on. We're going to go through. We got some long questions. Um, but some of these I think I can give more succinct answers we make our way through. >> Did you want to take a break or you want to do another? >> Uh, let's do a couple more. We'll take a break at the 30 minute one 1 hour and 30 minute mark. >> Okay.
--------------------------------------------------
[1:17:14] Why are stories like the Christmas narrative not told accurately?
Answer: I feel like this should have been public knowledge in the church. I shouldn't be finding this out this late into my life that the Greek for in means guest space and not public in. If it is indeed true that Mary and Joseph were in their relatives home in Bethlehem, not to mention the stable portion was part of the house and there just wasn't enough spa room for her to have her baby in the guest room because there were so many other relatives that have had that have to have space. Okay, I'm mixing up here. I'm sorry. >> This this email this email starts like it doesn't it doesn't have an introduction. It just says, "I feel like there should be a public knowledge in the church." And then it goes into this this this this argument about things about the Christmas narrative, the the nativity story that that um that this person recently found out. That's the So, it's a little bit hard understanding the context of what you are reading. Ultimately, the question is why are the stories uh why are the Christmas narrative uh not told accurately? And they talk about the fact that the inn was probably uh it wasn't a public in. It was more like a guest room in a family's home. Uh this the the stable was uh or the the the place where the the animals were were actually was part of the home. And uh there were just things. This person wrote this email basically saying why is it that we've had this wrong picture of the nativity? And and they're they said they're pretty upset about the one thing I was appreciative of. They said if I sounded upset in this email I'm not directing my upsetness at you. >> Yeah. Well, thank you for not directing your upsetness at me, but let me just say this about what you're saying. Yes, there are there are things about the nativity story which have become traditions like the barn picture that we often see, the nativity uh scene looks like the inside of a barn. Uh the uh uh there there's a there there's a lot in the story. the end there. Obviously, there wasn't a Motel 6 in Bethlehem, right? So, when it says the end, what is the end? Well, it's like you said, it was it was most likely the room in a in a home, a family home where people could stay, a guest space. Um, and and so I was trying to understand as I read your email, I was trying to understand why you were frustrated because you did say, you know, I'm I'm upset and and and I feel like this should be public knowledge. And I think that this is one of those times where I understand that you're you're frustrated because you feel like maybe things that you've been taught in the past didn't line up with exactly what was said in the text, but there are times where certain things are uh knowledge increases and and and and you said you watched a video about uh the someone teaching about this and it taught you some things that you didn't know before. Well, there there are people who have taught and read and and and and and sought to understand these texts that didn't know maybe some of what was in the video that you found or or some of the information that you found. And so, I don't the point I'm making is I don't think that the the the things that you learned in the past were intentionally misleading. I think a lot of people just read what's in the text and and and and sometimes they include anacronisms and things like at the end, right? We think about is there a Bethlehem in, right? We we we think about the inkeeper. Well, the Bible never mentions an inkeeper, right? But every play that I've ever seen that deals with the Christmas story has an inkeeper, right? Even though there wasn't an inkeeper. So, I I I I would step back and say I don't think that anyone who has taught on these texts or tried to explain these texts has been intentionally misleading. Maybe they just didn't understand what you now have learned about the the social atmosphere and the way that homes were built and things like that from the past. And some of this information does become more available to us through archaeological studies and through historical studies and studies of other documents, extra biblical sources and stuff like that. So, I wouldn't get upset that perhaps the picture you had in your mind is now different because you you've got new information. Um, I would just simply say that's what happens as as we learn. We we learn and grow. And I just can't I can't imagine someone knowing this and intentionally teaching it wrong. Sometimes traditions develop from a traditional understanding of the text that is not actually consistent with history, but at the same time doesn't mean that it was intentionally trying to change something. So I guess my answer and and I hope it makes sense. I hope people listening I haven't just lost everybody. But basically, my encouragement to you is to recognize that you're going to be a lifelong learner when it comes to scripture. And you're going to be learning things that maybe you thought were a certain way at one point. And now you learn a little bit better. And maybe you're going to learn m more than sometimes even what your teachers knew at a certain point. And that's good. So don't get upset when you learn something new. And don't feel like you've been misled if it's something different than what you were taught in the past. Just recognize that sometimes people have taught things that either they taught in ignorance, they didn't know, or they were taking the text in a way that were they were applying modern understandings to the text that they really were not right about, but they didn't know. They weren't doing it intentionally. And that's the part that I think is why I would avoid being upset about it. I don't think people are intentionally misleading when it comes to these things. And um I hope that makes sense. Am I >> making sense? >> It's just about being intentional, right? If somebody was intentionally misleading, they knew the facts, but then they were leading incorrectly, I think that would be a serious error. Also, when you when you when you're talking about the things that you've learned from this video that you watched, are you certain that everything in that video was correct? Have you researched that? Because I've seen guys who will come up with arguments from modern archaeology studies and they say, "Well, this must be what this was and this must be what that was." But then later that gets debunked. So, have you have you looked into what that video taught you to make sure that that is actually accurate? So, those are some things that I think are important uh to to not allow yourself to get so upset, but instead um just be thankful that the Lord is teaching you new things. And as he does then grow in his word and grow in his knowledge of him. And none of this Jennifer mentioned this because we talked about this in the car earlier because we we read through the questions early and we were reading through this question. Jennifer made a good point. None of this changes the heart of the gospel. And these are really incidental details about the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. None of this even really changes the narrative. Caught the pen. That was pretty awesome. I dropped it and caught it in the same hand. Um so don't allow this to cause you so much distress. That would be my encouragement to you. All right, let's uh move to the next question. >> Okay. >> Is it Wes Huff that did a video on it? Is that the Castle Keeper said that? Is that what the the the video that that Cuz let me see. She said >> I think someone else said Dr. White did too, but I don't think she said that. Um, oh, Kevin Aosta is a movie she mentioned. She said, "I found this out this year when I was 32 years old and by a Kevin Aosta movie I watched. I think that it's wrong. I've been in church all my life and I've never heard about this before." Again, though, some of this stuff is new information. Some of this stuff is is is stuff that a lot of pastors, teachers, a lot of people may not have known um as far as how the homes were built and things like that. So, I wouldn't I I I wouldn't I wouldn't take it as a I wouldn't take it as a thing to get offended by. >> Well, regardless, Mary wasn't giving birth in the bedroom in that part of the house. She was >> Jesus was laid miser. >> We have the text and we can go with what the text says, >> right? And whether the word in means a a room, a guest room, and a home. I did I taught on the nativity this year and uh I didn't even deal with a lot with this issue. What I did say was I believe Joseph's hometown was Bethlehem. I don't think that it was just the town of his ancestors. I think it was where Joseph was actually from. Um and I think he lived in in in Bethlehem and I think Mary lived in Nazareth and I think he he he he was he he was in Nazareth because he was betrod to her. But I think his home was in Bethlehem. That's I think that's pro his family home would have been in Bethlehem because that's where they would have lived during that several month period between the time of Jesus's birth and the time of their flight to Egypt which could have been up to over >> bless you >> over sorry over several months pardon me. Uh so there's a whole lot about the nativity story. If you want to hear my teaching on it, go to sermon audio. Uh or actually go to our um it's not on sermon audio, it's on our our sovereign grace YouTube channel. You'll see uh my teaching through the nativity, which is I compared Mark's go or Matthew's gospel and Luke's gospel on the history of the nativity. All right, let's uh let's move on. >> Okay. I'm a 21-year-old male who recently left
--------------------------------------------------
[1:27:14] Can you recommend pastors who do not agree with you on everything?
Answer: my family's independent Pentecostal Holiness Church due to their beliefs on salvation. The pastor there teaches that a person is not saved unless they have spoken in tongues, which I have not. Because of this teaching, I was never baptized. Even though I first came to faith over 5 years ago, leaving has been quite challenging as my family is deeply rooted in these beliefs. My uncle is even the co-pastor of the church. I should also clarify that my disagreement is not limited to that church, but extends to the broader Pentecostal view of salvation. I have watched your comedy videos for quite some time and have recently started listening to your theology content as well. The main reason I'm reaching out is that you consistently ground your positions in careful exesus of the text. I'm wondering if there are theologians, pastors or teachers you would recommend for understanding systematic theology, especially sotiology and esquetology who also faithfully exedute scripture but arrive at different conclusions than you do. Okay. >> Okay. Um, that was a lot to to to uh uh to to go through. Thank you for for reaching out. Number one, let me just say this about the Pentecostal Holiness Church that if anyone says that you're not saved because you haven't spoken in tongues. That is absolutely false. There's no scriptural warrant for that claim. There's no scriptural evidence that all believers must speak in tongues. In fact, the Apostle Paul says the opposite. He says, "Do all speak with tongues?" And the answer is no. All do not speak with tongues. Just like all do not prophesy and all do not have the gifts uh no one has all the gifts and no one no one gift is given to all people including the gift of tongues. Now I believe that uh when we when we start going down that road, there's a lot of other things in the Pentecostal charismatic teaching that we could talk about, but that's one. Someone says you have to speak in tongues to be a believer, I just say that there's no evidence of that. No evidence of that in scripture and and it's that there's just a no reason to believe that at all. Now, you asked the question though, uh are there theologians, pastors or teachers who you would recommend for understanding systematic theology who are faithfully executing scripture but arrive at different conclusions than you do? Well, basically you're asking me, are there pastors that I disagree with that I still listen to? And the answer is yes. David Guzzk would be a good example of this. David Guzzk wrote the Enduring Word commentary. He also has the Enduring Word study Bible, which I have one right over there. Uh David Guzik is from the Calvary Chapel Movement, but David Guzik is he's not a Calvinist. He's a dispensationalist. So, I believe he's wrong on a few things. But David and I are both brothers in the Lord. We love each other and we love the Lord together. And uh so he would be one that I would say, "Yeah, I would recommend his commentary to you. I would recommend his study Bible to you." Uh I I don't agree with Presbyterians on everything, but I would definitely recommend their resources to you. James Montgomery Boyce was a tremendous teacher, theologian, and pastor, and I use his commentary on the Gospel of John as I'm preparing my sermons on that gospel. So there's another one who I would not agree with 100%. FF Bruce was more of a continuationist and someone who I would disagree with on certain things, but his commentary on the go on the book of Acts as well as several other uh books that he has written have been tremendously beneficial to me. So there are just three right off the top of my head that are from different uh faith traditions that I would appreciate and would point you to. Um, as far as a systematic theology, most of the ones that I would recommend would probably come more from the reformed line. Uh, uh, my favorite systematic theology is James Pedigrew Boyce, which was, uh, he was first president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. And I I have that one right over there. And to me, honestly, it's just a tremendous work, and it's over 200 years old. And so he's an example of of one that I would recommend, a good resource. He's not from a different tradition, though. You asked me about people from different different faith traditions. He's just one that I recommend a lot. Uh and that that's my answer. I mean, I I could spend all night just walking through different guys, but if you know, you asked, "Are there theologians, pastors, and teachers you'd recommend for understanding systematic theology?" Yes, there are. I gave you a few. Um, I honestly am not I I I I would have a hard time pointing to any charismatic teachers. Like I said, I I said that, you know, I mentioned FF Bruce, continuationist, but um, someone full full-on charismatic, I would have a hard time pointing you to because a lot of those guys I I don't really don't really read a whole lot of their material. So, uh, that that would be a hard one for me to come off come up with off top of my head. Any thoughts? Any questions? Anybody? Uh, somebody mentioned Wayne Grudam. That that's a good question. Wayne Grudum is uh uh uh we have used his material in our sovereign grace academy. So we do endorse his material and Wayne Grudum is a continuationist and he has a systematic theology and his his his section on sotariology would be Calvinistic. So it would agree with me for the most part. So um I would say we probably have great great agreement on on most everything. So Wayne Gruden would be a good example of someone that I would point you to. All right, moving on to the next question. We got we we we we're going to take this and then we're going to take a break. >> Okay.
--------------------------------------------------
[1:33:02] How to respond to universalist arguments
Answer: >> I haven't been listening long, but I love your content and especially your how cordial you are with about other denominations. I have run into an issue recently. An acquaintance of mine that I used to go to church with has over the last year or so moved into the universalist camp. He says it is the most historic position uh the most dominant in the very early church and was overtaken only in the fourth or fifth century by ect. We've discussed online, which is of course the best place for reasonable dialogue on controversial subjects, but I can't really get him to answer how he squares eternal punishment in Matthew 25:46. He just says there's something about first century Jews not having a concept for eternity, fire is for purification, etc. How do I answer him biblically? >> Okay. Uh right away uh when I first read your question, I kind of got a little confused because you said that you have a friend who is going into the universalist camp and and then you said that he was arguing against etern eternal conscious torment, ect, which made me think maybe what you meant was that he was going into the annihilationist camp, which would also uh be opposed to ect. But then I got to thinking about it. No, you you probably did mean universalist because a universalist would obviously reject eternal conscious torment because they don't believe anyone is going to be punished for anything because ultimately the universalist would say all would ultimately be redeemed. Even though some people would say the redeemed comes after a time of punishment or purification, right? But ultimately in the universalist view, everybody eventually gets saved. So, uh how do you how do you respond? Well, I'm going to respond from the position of the historical argument. His argument, he says, according to you, he says that um it's the most historical position. I don't think that that I don't think that that's the case. I think that it is very easy to cherrypick uh quotes from church fathers to try to make arguments for certain positions. And I know this for a fact because I watched Dale Tuggy do this. Yes, that's his real name, Dale Tuggy. Uh Dale Tuggy debated James White this year and I was there in the audience. They debated the subject of the Trinity. Dale Tuggy is a Unitarian and he argued that all of the early church fathers prior to the time of Nya that all the early church fathers believed in different views of the divinity of Christ and there wasn't a there wasn't a real unilateral view and ultimately he argued that the unitarian view that God is divine and Jesus Christ is uh uh uh the the word of God made flesh, but that that he did not pre-exist the his his birth that that that idea is what was was what was believed by the early fathers. And he was pulling out this quote and this and this other quote and and it just proved to me and and I made this argument on a previous show. It proved to me that if you just take cherrypicked quotes from the early fathers, you can make them say just about anything you want. And um and so when he says, "Well, the most the the the the the view of the uh how do you say it? I'm trying to find it here. The the the most historic position and the dominant position is universalism." I don't think that that's accurate. I I I I would I would press hard against that. I would say prove it. If you if if you want to say that the that the position of the early church was that everyone goes to heaven, that everyone ultimately is redeemed by Christ, and that no one suffers eternal punishment. One, I would say you I don't think you can square that with Daniel 12. I don't think you can square that with uh the Gospels. I don't think you can square that with the writings of Paul. certainly don't think you can square that with Revelation which talks about the the the wicked being cast into the lake of fire where they will suffer right eternally. I don't I don't think that you can square universalism with any of that. And the early fathers I don't think would have agreed with that either. And so I would I would tell him it's the onus is on you to prove that and not just with one or two quotes. I I'm going to need to see some pretty substantial evidence and I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it. So, that that's that's that's that would be my answer. All right. Uh Lampert said, "How do I ask a question? I do have uh do I have to do a super chat?" No, you don't have to do a super chat, but here's a thing that you do need to know. Uh we we we receive questions via email. These emails come in throughout the week and they have priority.

Just want to say thank you that he says he prays that the Lord will continue to feed us from his word in the coming year. God bless. Thank you so much for that. Potato sandwich. Michael Foster came in and said he wanted me to sing Journey. I'm trying to think of a Journey song. >> Just a Small Town. >> Is that Is that it? Yeah. Okay. Uh well, Michael's probably gone by now. I know he probably didn't hang out for the whole two hours, but if he does hear this, just a small girl living in a lonely world. She took the midnight train going anywhere. >> I love to hear you say, "Okay, you're supposed to." Okay. All right. And then, of course, Aztec, thank you for that wonderful donation, brother. We appreciate it. Daily reforming says, "Is it okay to be a member of a less than ideal church that you are gathering and have the fellowship, etc., and then to worship with SGFC Jacks online?" Well, um I mean, >> yeah. I mean, I would say this, we we we love to know that you're out there watching and being with us online, but certainly try to be as faithful as you can to your local church. That that would be my my admonition. And and if it's less than ideal, there's no perfect church. and be be as faithful as you can to the most faithful church you can. That would be that would be my admonition. But certainly continue to watch and we hope that it continues to be a blessing to you. Uh Michael Coggin says, "Happy New Year's. Have you experienced a significant drop in attendance in your church? I'm a pastor and a group of the Filipinos recently stopped attending our church to start a church. I'm happy for them, but it was discouraging." Um I Yes. You you asked, "Have we ever experienced a significant drop in attendance?" That's that's a good question, Michael. And my answer is we we have gone we have ups and downs. I I I preached on this last Sunday. In fact, you might do well to go and listen to my sermon from last week. Michael, uh if you go to SGFC Jack's, go to the live and the last live video is our last service. I end up preach an hour and 10 minutes. I rarely do that, but I preached a long time on the history of our church and where we've gone this year and where we're going. And one of the things I prayed and asked the people to consider was to consider consistency because we do have an issue with sometimes we'll have really low attendance, sometimes we have really high attendance. And that lack of consistency, I think really is hurtful and it causes us causes us to struggle. So um uh brother, I think that message might be an encouragement to you. So go go and check that out. And if you if you can't find it, send me an email and I'll send you a link. Um, but yeah, we we deal with all kinds of different issues and there is just no there is just no perfect church that you're not going to find one. Uh, already talked about Protestia. Thank you again for that. That and was that all of them? >> I think that was all of them. Great. Well, want to make sure we we say thanks to everybody who's doing the super chats and certainly we have a lot of people out there that are commenting. Where where did our commenting? Where' they go? There they are. Their live chat right there. All right. Um, we only have a few questions left. We're gonna try to make it through the end uh of tonight. What? What's up, Jennifer? You keep looking. >> No, I just like this quote. Tea Chap says, Adrienne Rogers once said, "If you find a perfect church, don't join it because it won't be perfect." >> That's right. You will ruin it. Do you have anything to drink? >> Yeah, lemonade. >> May I? >> Yeah. >> Thank you. All right. So, uh, um, >> this this next question is such a good question regarding what so many people, I'm sure, are going through. So, Jennifer, I'd like for you to read it. Um, and and and the only thing I would say >> would be able to >> maybe uh there's one thing I would say right here, just leave that out. >> Okay. >> Okay. All right. Go ahead. M >> looking for some wisdom on navigating sin in my 13-year-old son's life. He has been open that he is struggling with porn. A bit of background. We have always been very cautious about giving him access to media on TV or internet access. He does not have a laptop uh he uses or a smartphone. But back in February, he had to spend some time at my parents while I was in the hospital. They let him spend a lot of time on a tablet online for those two days. It was here where he encountered it porn and I feel like it's had a hold of him ever since. We finally got him a flip phone with no data on it. Um it is Wi-Fi enabled. We didn't connect to our Wi-Fi, but he has admitted that when he goes out, he connects to hotspots and tries to find inappropriate things. We have now taken this phone from him as well. He professes Christ and I feel on one hand he is battling it but on the other hand he is seeking porn and self-pleasure as well. I have had some discussions with him about staying in God's word in prayer and he also has been reading a book on overcoming temptation. I also have encouraged him not to be be idol. There is more I could share but I'll leave it at that. So my question is do you have any wisdom on this? Do you have any suggestion for resources that could help guide him and myself through this? Thank you. >> Okay. Uh first of all I just want to uh say this is this is such a common issue today that I would say this is the scourge of our generation because the the internet has made access to pornography so easy and so fast and It it it it it the amount of people that need help, counseling, prayer in this area is so high that it it's hard to even it's hard to even relate how high and and and how much it is. Um and uh I I do have to just mention somebody said, "Do you still like Fresca?" Yes, I do. And this has nothing to do with the question. And someone said I shouldn't be drinking from a red solo cup because that apparently is bad. It looks like >> I think they were joking. I think they were joking. >> I like we're in a kitchen remodel. Everything is >> Yeah, everything's red. Right now we're eating off paper plates and red solo cups. So um but this is what Jennifer and I were reading this in the car and um we're driving going to pick up a new table tonight and we were talking about this question and we both said the same thing. You're doing everything right. that and and and I rarely would say that, but based on everything you wrote about what you've done with your son and trying to take away the outside the the outside opportunities for him to seek out pornography, whether it be through a phone or internet or whatever, whether it be um praying with him, pointing him to Christ, and offering up uh opportunities for him to study things like you said you you had a book that you were reading him on overcoming temptation. And I can't really add a lot to what you're already doing other than to say that I'm going to pray for you right now. I'm going to pray for him because this is such a dangerous scourge. This is such a terrible thing that has made its way into the lives of our of our men and and women, but but men in particular and boys. Um the the the visual medium of pornography is such an allure to men and it is such a dangerous and and evil thing and yet so so uh appealing to the flesh and and and and draws in the mind and the and the and the lust. And so I I want to pray for you, Jen. We're going to pray for him. But before we do, I just want to sayntion I think you are

[1:48:00] How to help a teen struggling with lust
Answer: >> based on what you wrote, you are trying your best to do a good job. and I can just pray for you and say, don't give up. Trust the Lord. As far as resources, I there there there are a few out there that are good. I there was a book years ago that was written. I mentioned it on the show before. It's a book called Every Man's Battle. Some people don't like it. Some people don't think it's great, but I will say this. I read it when it first came out, and I thought it did do a good job of one thing. It pointed out the the the reality of how easy it is for men to fall into the trap of lust and how how quickly lust can overtake someone and how and I just think that book did a good job of pointing that out. It had some its recommendations like bouncing the eyes and things like that might be might be a little oversimplified, but I still think what it did in pointing out the issue and and helping see what the issues are, I think it was was good for that. So, if you can get a I found a copy of that in a used bookstore recently and I I grabbed it because I was like, you know what, I'm going to get I'm going to have this for the next person I talk to that deals with this. It might give them something that um that that could be useful. So, uh, so, so that that's that's an old resource. I'm sure there's better ones. I'm sure there's guys who who've written other things. In fact, I I'll give you give me one second. Did Did you want to >> Oh, yeah. Shall Finally Free by Heath Lambert. >> Okay. Finally Free by Heath Lambert. Let me look one other quick thing >> and just Can I talk real quick? >> Yeah. No, please. just I got this this might be a little young for 13 but a couple of years ago I got this book with my for my older well at the time 11 8 you know um it's called good pictures bad pictures and it's a book that you can walk through together and it talks about kind of the addictive nature like your brain is just not able to process what it's seeing and what to do if you accidentally see it on a phone or what Um, it might be a little a little young, but it was helpful for for us. >> There was a book that someone sent me, and I can't find the name of it. Um, I think it was called Was it What was you? What did you just say? >> Good pictures, bad pictures. >> And what was the name of I think there was a name called Finally Free. >> Oh, >> let me look it up real quick. Maybe. I'm sorry. I I don't want to take too much time here, but um >> Yeah, every man's battle. That's that that was the one you were talking about. >> Yeah. No, but there was a I I you guys may not know this, but I have a lot of people that send me books to read and to give uh uh endorsements for and things like that. And >> freedom from that one. >> Freedom from Lust by Jared Moore, I think is the name of it here. Yeah. 33 Days to Freedom from Lust by Dr. Jared Moore, but I don't know if it's out yet. It's copyrighted this year and I wrote I think I wrote an endorsement for it. I have to go look back go back and look that up. That one would be one I would look for when it comes out. I think that's still in the in the in the production phase. But again, going back, we're going to pray right now for this young man. Pray for this family. And just know you're not alone. This is a problem that's common to many people. having conversations with your son about it, giving him accountability. Things that you're already doing are the right things and continue to do them. >> Father, we pray for this man. We pray for his son. We pray for this sin of of of lust that it would be be taken away from him. And Lord, that he would be able to be lifted up to uh learn what real manhood and real virtue is. And and it is is avoiding the horish woman, avoiding the the one the woman who is a deep ditch who would lead you down to hell. Lord, what the Proverbs tells these dangerous dangerous things that come and and and provide lust of the eyes and lust of the flesh. And so, Lord, I pray for him. I pray, Lord, that you would sanctify him. That you would keep him from this sin. And that you would give his father and mother wisdom as they seek to minister to their son who they love. And I pray, Lord, that they would continue to love him and be patient with him as he struggles with this. And I do l pray Lord that your Holy Spirit would fill him, would keep him from temptation. And Lord, that you would deliver him from this evil sin that is so easily uh easily gotten today, so easily sought out today. I pray that you would help him and that you would draw him away from that, Lord. That you would give him godly sorrow which leads to repentance. We pray this in Jesus name. Amen. All right, getting close to the end. Getting close to the end. All right, we got another super chat came in from Rumbleard. Thank you so much. We appreciate the donation. It's very much a blessing to our family and we thank you for it. All right, we are

[1:53:05] How did I come to my conclusion about young earth creation?
Answer: at 153. >> Thank you so much for your show, Mr. Fosski. I've had a question on my heart for several months and wanted to seek your insight. I've been wrestling with where I land on Genesis 1. I've studied both positions, young earth creationism and old earth creationism, and I can see see the appeal of each. After watching your debate with Redeem Zoomer, I thought it would be helpful to ask you how you personally came to your conclusion. All of my elders hold to a young earth view, and we have had many good and thoughtful discussions about it. At the same time, I am a public school student and have studied the scientific evidence for an old earth, which I find compelling in many ways. My greatest concern is remaining faithful to scripture. I do not want to compromise biblical authority, yet I also want to think carefully and honestly about the evidence I've encountered. Do you have any advice for someone navigating this? >> Yeah, very, very good question. Uh, before we go into that though, somebody said Rewire Your Heart by David Bowen. I've never read that, but I'm putting it up there as a viewer a viewer recommendation for this uh for the last question. So, Rewire Your Heart by David Bowen. check that out. That might be a a great resource. Um, when it comes to the question of why I am how did I come to my conclusion about young earth creation. Well, uh, two things lead me to the well, three things lead me to the young earth position. Uh the most specific thing that leads me to the young earth position is I I I think that the uh the Bible supports a uh a created universe that was created in its in its maturity. Uh that that's the best way I can describe it. Adam when he was created was not created as an as a as a as a fetus. and then grew into a baby and or Venus is a baby. Let me back up. He he he was he wasn't he wasn't born. Adam was created fully formed and we don't know how old he was, how he looked, but we know how old he was on day one. He was one day old, but he looked probably like he was 30, right? Adam had all the things that a 30-year-old man would have. He had hair on his body. He had muscles on his flesh. He had all the things that a 30-year-old man would appear to have. And if a scientist looked at him on day one and they said, "You are 30 years old." He would say, "No, I'm one day old because that's the way I was created." And so when the world was created, uh I I think it's I think it's somewhat difficult to say, "Well, we're going to look at the evidence of history and and and determine how old the earth is." Because when we do it that way, we're we're we're looking at something that we can't really measure. We can't measure time and history. Uh we can we can make some assumptions based upon things like carbon dating and things like that which which can can be demonstrated to have erroneous results. But we can we we there's a different this is this is an area where I agree with Ken Ham. Kenham says there's a difference between observational science and historical science. Observational science says I'm going to test water boiling at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. I'm going to I'm going to test it and and it's going to boil at 212 degrees and it's going to do it every time that I do it. That is a repeatable I have a I have a experiment that I can do. I can repeat that experiment over and over and over and every time I do the experiment it shows me that water boils at 212 degrees. What I can't do is I can't say for certain that a particular rock structure took 30,000 years to produce. Even though they'll say, well, we know that this because this is the amount of erosion that happens every year and this is how much erosion has been happening and therefore we know for sure this is how long this rock surface has been here, this rock structure. So something like the Grand Canyon or something like that. The problem with that is you can't you you you weren't there to examine the evidence as it was taking place. And I I like the Mount St. Helens argument. The the year I was born, Mount St. Helens erupted and it laid down a series of rock layers that in a in one afternoon it laid down what the natural processes of geological rock formation would have taken years to produce. But it happened in one afternoon. And so this is one of those times where when you when you ask the scientists and you say, "How old is something?" They're having to make some assumptions based upon what they see now. That's called historical science. That's looking at history and trying to make scientific determinations based upon what they can look at right now. Nobody can look a thousand years ago. Nobody can look 5,000 years ago. Nobody can look 10,000 years ago. um they can make assumptions about that. They can make scientific evaluations about that, but at the same time they can't know for certain and the one place that we do have certainty is from God's word. This again going back to Ken Ham, I do like what he says. He says there's one person who was there when the world was created and that's God. And so if we want to know how and when it was created, we go to God's word. Now God's word doesn't say that the earth is young. God's word simply says that God created the world in six days. And there are those who do believe that the days the young earth position that it can actually be expanded out and each one of those days could be longer periods of time. But the issue I take is when you start looking at the millions of years and billions of years, you realize how long a billion is. If you think of time in terms of seconds, a million seconds from now is 11 days from now. But a billion seconds from now is 30 years from now. Isn't that crazy? Just to think of the distinction between a million and a billion. So when we think about a billion years, the the the earth should be four and a half billion years old. The universe must be 13 billion years old. Then the the sheer numbers of that is astronomically just to me is out out of this world that I would consider that that would be accurate. Doesn't make sense to me. And it certainly doesn't line up with what I think the Bible teaches. Even if the Bible does give us an older earth, I don't think we're in the terms of billions of years. Uh uh that that that's again that's an opinion based on the text, but that's that's that's how I arrive at that. But the other issue and the major issue from a theological perspective is the issue of death. If you believe in sin bringing three things into the world, the Bible says sin brings three things. Death, disease, and destruction. Death, disease, and destruction came as a result of the fall. If you have death, disease, and destruction prior to the fall, then you have the consequences of sin without sin. And I think that's the biggest theological hurdle for me. And that's where I arrive at a young earth position. I don't believe that death, disease, and destruction were in the world prior to the fall. Now, you might say, "So, do you not think animals died before the fall?" Actually, I don't. But at the same time, I I I would hold that one a little less specific than I would say man. I say I don't believe man died prior to sin. In fact, I know that man did not die prior to sin. Um but I also don't believe animals did either. I believe animals were um were herbivore prior to the fall. I believe uh omnivore and carnivore was a result of what happened after the fall. Um, so that those are positions that are typical young earth positions, but um, but again, death, disease, and destruction prior to the fall, we we end up with a world that God created that was very good, but was filled with cancer. It was filled with with heart disease. It was filled with with with uh all kinds of other sicknesses, and that's all prior to the fall. I take a a big issue with that. So, that's how I arrived at my conclusion. And >> I agree with this, Scott. I think God planned painless child birth prefall. Sorry, ladies. >> Yeah. No, I agree. I I agree. Uh the master's call. Wait a minute. I got to respond to this. I don't know who this person is. It might be new to the channel and thank you for jumping in. But he says, "Adam was formed, not created." That's that. Are you saying that when something's formed, it's not created? that that I don't I don't understand the the nuance that you're trying to produce there. But to be honest with you, when God formed Adam, he was he created Adam. So I I don't see a distinction there or if if anything, it's a distinction without a difference. So um yeah. So again, I um I I I I think I guess I guess the argument that maybe that they're making that person was making was that Adam Adam came from a lower life form. Some people believe in in uh theistic evolution and say Adam Adam was taken from a a lower homminid and God gave him the imodi or the image of God and changed him. So uh yeah, >> look the this young man was on. Thank you so much for your insight. Your response was very beneficial to me. >> Great. Wonderful. Well, I'm glad I >> And I did catch this. I when we listened to it, I am a public school student, so current like a young man. >> Well, good. >> Like in public school. >> Good. Well, >> it's nice to see young young viewers. >> Yes. Always viewers are always happy. All right. Well, thank you for your question. I'm glad that was helpful. Let's move on. We've only got a couple questions left and uh we're going to try to finish out tonight.
--------------------------------------------------
[2:02:54] How much time should a Christian spend reading God's word every day?
Answer: >> My question is about Bible reading. There are so many biblical resources out there, books, sermons, podcasts, etc. But sometimes I'm afraid I put more emphasis on these rather than on simply reading the Bible itself. Then of course there are just the everyday demands of life. I was raised in a legalistic you can be good enough for God environment and that put heavy emphasis on quiet times. So sometimes I can feel that pressure to just check it off the daily list. But I also want to be on guard against swinging the other way and living with a grace abounds mindset where which is really no need for that discipline. Also, I'm asking this question within the context of knowing that the Bible is where God's character is revealed and ultimately how we know we love him and what he is like. I tell my kids that neglecting God's word is like having a spouse who you love, but you never talk to them and live in complete silence. You have no idea what their character is like. what their interests are or what they expect from you. God has made known through his word. But since it would not be feasible to spend every waking hour reading it, I want to ask you, how much time should a Christian spend reading God's word every day? >> Honestly, great question, great subject. I will say this, uh you you mentioned there's so many biblical resources, books, sermons, podcasts, etc. But sometimes you're you're afraid you put more emphasis on that than simply reading the Bible. I think that that is that that's actually something that is is pretty common because it's easier to listen to a podcast or listen to a sermon than it is to actually read the Bible. Um because reading the Bible takes a certain amount of focus and uh you can just listen to a podcast and sort of let your mind you know uh just just go. I know there are people who tell me they listen to our podcast while cleaning their house or while working or driving their cars. And so it's not something you have to be totally engaged with. And and reading takes takes a certain amount of thought. It takes a certain amount of focus to actually sit and read what what what's in front of you. Um, and so yeah, there there is something that's that's more uh uh uh just more engaged with reading, I guess, is the point I'm making. But let me let me though say this. U how much time should a Christian spend reading God's word every day? There there's no answer to that that I can give because as soon as I give you an answer, what I've done is I've set for you some kind of a legalistic standard for you to meet. Instead of telling you you should read your Bible 10 minutes a day, you should read your Bible 20 minutes a day, or you should read three chapters a day because if you read three chapters a day, you'll read the whole Bible in a year or something like that. Rather than giving you an arbitrary standard, what I'd rather say is there are three ways to read the Bible, and you need to decide what way you're going to try to read it and and and and understand why you're doing it. The first way that you read the Bible is what's known as devotional reading. And that's where you're simply reading the Bible and you're not seeking necessarily to interpret it. You're not seeking necessarily to execute it. You're just reading it and you're uh taking in what you understand from that passage and seeking to make some type of an application and you're you're you're you're just getting you're just getting the word of God into you. And that's good. That's a good thing to do. Devotional reading. And if you did that every day, it would be helpful to you. The Bible says, "Thy word I've hid in my heart that I may not sin against you." So, devotional reading is good. You're just getting it into you, right? And it and and and you're not arguing or wrestling with the word. You're not you're not you're not you uh necessarily seeking exesus or interpretation. You're just reading the word, getting the word of God into you. That's good. The second way that you can read the word is by seeking to uh to dive deeply into the word and try to to to parse and to nuance and to understand what the text is saying. And that is more of a deeper of a study. And I don't expect that you would do that every single day. Uh and unless that's what you're planning to do for a certain period of time over a certain particular passage or a certain particular book, right? And so you may change from doing devotional reading for a couple of months to then doing a a a good strong study of the the Gospel of Matthew for 30 days or something like that, right? There might be a change. And so changing up how you read might be good. And then of course there's times where you might want to devote yourself to the memorizing of scripture. I already said that one passage, the um thy word I've hid in my heart that I may not sin against you. So my my question to you back to you would be what are you hoping to accomplish? Are you just wanting to get the scripture into you? Are you wanting to better understand a certain section of scripture? Or are you wanting to memorize and have at your disposal much of scripture through memor memorizing the text? And so those are different ways and different focuses that you can have while you're reading the scripture. But all of those are just I can't say read 10 minutes a day and that's your goal. Read 20 minutes a day, that's your goal. Read three chapters a day and that's your goal. Because I'm I I can't give you an arbitrary standard like that because all I do when I do that is set a legalistic standard. Here's something I will tell you about my own personal Bible reading, my own personal uh uh investment in the word is I I am more the second type. I am I'm I'm studying for a purpose. I want to know what the word says about a particular thing. And so even though I do have a regular routine of reading through scripture devotionally, I'm almost always on the other side also doing some intentional exposition. Sometimes it's for the sermons that I'm teaching, sometimes it's for articles or things that I'm writing, and sometimes it's just because I want to know about something. And so uh that's the way I keep myself invested in the word is by diving into these subjects and trying to learn as much as I can about a particular passage or a particular book or a particular subject in the scripture. So just remember there's not one way to read the Bible and there's not one standard for how long you should read the Bible every day. But just if God is the passion of your heart and the desire of your heart, seek him in every way that you can. And if you use podcasts and sermons to build that up, that's great. But the source is always going to be the word of God. Can I read something real quick? Yeah. >> Just real fast. Um, this is I was talking to my Sunday school class about resolutions. And Jonathan um Edwards, one of his resolutions was resolved to study the scripture so steadily, constantly, and frequently as that I may find and plainly perceive myself to grow in the knowledge of the same. So, it's not like a certain amount or certain number just are you growing, but all of those things like you mentioned are are going to do that. >> Yep. Uh, I I I like this one. Fast Daddy put, "I was about to mention the difference between devotional and deep study. Do you find it hard to switch between the two?" Not not not normally. Great question, Fast, but because normally my if I if I'm doing devotionals say like Jennifer and I, we we didn't do it much this year, but but in years past, we've like read the same passages every day. Like we have a Bible app that we use that we try to read the same one. This year we're switching to the yearly Bible app, which is the one from uh uh the Martin Chamberlain who put put out Tiny Bibles. He has the yearly Bible app. And this year we're using that one uh to begin our devotional reading. And so that way we have the same we're reading the same thing every day, but that's not what I'm studying. That's just what I'm doing to get the Bible into me. Uh the actual one that I'm studying usually is something different and it's focused on something else. So I'm able to separate the two because I keep them both sort of categorized in my brain. But when I am reading through, I tell you what, stuff comes up that I'm like, ah, I got to look deeper into that because that's >> squirrel. >> Yeah, for sure. >> All right, guys. Uh, let's do these last three. I'm I'm going to help out. I'm going to jump in here. Okay. Uh, uh, we're at
--------------------------------------------------
[2:11:05] Where does a discerning Christian draw the line as it pertains to “conservative” Christian media?
Answer: 21:05. This next question, it's long. I'm just going to summarize it. Where does a discerning Christian draw the line as it pertains to conservative Christian media? The person asking the question is asking um what about guys who are conservative in their positions, but they're going into places that you don't agree with. And he mentions a few names here. I'm not going to I'm not going to name not because I'm afraid of naming names, but I just don't want to get into uh some of this some of the areas that this would take take me tonight. But basically, the question is um where do you draw the line? Where do you draw the line uh when it comes to who you listen to in the in in Christian conservative circles? Because here's the thing, things have gotten weird in the online uh sort of atmosphere. Uh uh the the especially the Christian online atmosphere. There's a lot of weird stuff that goes on. And as I said in my I I mentioned this earlier when I was at Michael Foster's church this year, somebody asked, "How do we how do we not how do we uh fight against the crazy things that are happening online?" And I said, 'D don't feed the stupid. And I and I'm going to keep saying that. >> We should put that on a shirt. >> Don't feed the stupid. >> Don't feed the stupid. Meaning, if you know that there are guys out there that are teaching things that are just not right or teaching things that are weird or teaching things that are are stupid, don't go there. Don't encourage people to go there. And when you see those guys, don't share their stuff. Don't quote their stuff. Don't endorse their stuff. Just ignore it. Just leave it alone. Don't feed the stupid. The only thing that keeps these guys going is the attention that they're given. And so that that that's one thing. Um the second thing is where do you draw the line? I mean there are guys that I disagree with about some stuff, some pretty serious stuff, but I still think that they're Christians, right? But there are other guys that when I see them and I and I see their behavior, hold on. >> Bless you. and I see their behavior and I see what they're saying and I see their lifestyle, the way they portray themselves, I'm like, I just don't want anything to do with those guys. And this is this this is a big part of what discernment is. Discernment is not knowing the difference between right and wrong, but as Spurgeon said, uh, knowing the difference between right and almost right, right? There's some guys out there who are almost right, but they're just wrong enough to be dangerous. And so, you got to be careful. You got to watch out for those guys. You got to say to yourself, do I really want to do is it worth listening to this guy? Is there not a better guy? Right? Is this really the best we have? Right? Is this is there not better people to teach me? And uh one of the one of the really good things that you can do is actually start to listen to people from the past. Like start listening to read some of the Puritans. start listening to pastors from 30, 50, 100, 200 years ago. Like, how can you listen to them? We had to read them because they didn't have audios. Uh >> audio has someone read. >> Yeah. Some of that you can listen to. Yeah. And there's uh um my friend uh who has the uh Revived Thoughts, the Revived Thoughts podcast. I've read some of the sermons for him. He takes sermons from people like John John Calvin and others, puts their information out there. Um, and so go and do that and and and the question of how do you draw the line truth? If there's somebody out there who is perpetuating error or perpetuating the questions like, well, I'm not saying it, but I'm I'm just throwing out the question and it's something that is wildly misinformed or dangerous. that person is probably not worth you devoting your time to listening to. There's so much out there to listen to and so many people to listen to. You don't need to feed the stupid. And I'll leave it. >> That's right, Jessica. We need shirts. Don't feed the stupid. >> Yep. I'm going to do it. Don't feed the stupid. All right. >> Okay. >> 215 and 25.
--------------------------------------------------
[2:15:25] How should a husband and wife work together to shepherd their children?
Answer: >> I have a question about how a husband and wife should be working together to shepherd their children. All right. Okay. That this is a long question, but basically >> I I I hate because we're so close to the end. I feel like we're we're we're going to have to to to kind of give this a short answer, but we talked a lot about this one in the car to the person who wrote this question in the the the basically, let me summarize. You've got a a husband and wife who have struggled with his spiritual leadership, who have struggled with her spiritual submission to him. He has had some errors in the past. She has had some errors in the past. They're both recognizing their errors and now they're trying to figure out how to work through the struggles of the past and how to actually come to a right understanding of her position as submitting to him and his position as leading her. Am I am I that's right getting that pretty well? >> And ultimately, what are they supposed to be doing? And I I I think maybe I could read this part. Um um neither of us has a firm grasp on which roles are whose. And I feel like it's leading to absolute chaos in our parenting. I overstep and he overreacts. He hesitates and I overreact. I want to create the space he needs to lead our family, but I'm afraid to completely leave our kids in the dark while he finds his way there. How do we navigate that? If you have any resources on the matter, we would love to have something to study together. Thank you for your faithfulness. I've really enjoyed your podcast since I found you a few months ago. Thank you for all that. Let me let me say this. Number one, I'll give you the resources. I do think that this is something Jennifer and I use when we're counseling uh husbands and wives. We counsel couples. Uh the exemplary husband by Stuart, what's his last name? >> I'll find it. >> It's Stuart. I think it's Scott. Uh the exemplary husband and the extra uh uh extraordinary wife. >> Excellent. >> Excellent wife by Martha Peace. Right. >> Those are two books if you have not read them. Uh they're they're complimentary books and they're good for for him and for you. And so I would uh I would definitely go and and check those out. Um >> Stuart Scott. >> Stuart Scott. That's I was going to say Steuart Scott. Why didn't I just say it? Yeah. Okay. All right. You know, I was thinking Steuart Smallley. >> He's a Gary Small. >> Gary Smallley. Yeah, I was thinking of that. But um but but that that's the recommendation I would give you. But but here's something else I would say. Um, as I read your email and I was thinking through the the problems that you re that you that you were saying here here's here's my my my my thought. Number one, there's there's two passages of scripture that I want you to really spend your time meditating on. One, um, for you the wife, I I want you to spend some time really thinking about Hey, Watchwell just came into the chat. Uh, Parker, the fetus is out there >> at 11:18. >> 11:118. Yeah, we're almost finished. Uh, I really want you, the wife, to consider what it means to respect your husband. And I really want your husband to consider what it means to live with you in an understanding way. We're told in scripture that a husband is to live with his wife in an understanding way so that his prayers would not be hindered. What does it mean to live in an understanding way? Well, that's what it means to love. Because a husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the church. And the wife is to respect her husband, submit to her husband. Um, are you submitting to your husband or are you only submitting to yourself? I've told this story before. I think it's I think it's a good a good illustration. And if you haven't heard it, I I'll make it quick. A um a father called his son into his office and he said uh he said, "Son, I I'm I'm trying to get everything prepared. I know that my life is short and I want to get some things prepared. So, I'm going to give you I want I want you to take some money out of our account. They were in business together. I want you to take some money out of our account and set up a trust fund for your kids. And the son said, "I agree with that. That's a great idea." And he did it. Couple weeks later, the father brought him in. He said, "Hey, we've got we've got some stocks we need to sell. I want you to sell some of that stock. Put that money into an account for your mother so that when something happens to me, your mother's taken care of." And the son says, "I agree with that, Dad. Let's do that." And he did it. and he actually set up the account for the mom. Well, couple weeks go by and the father called the son in again and he says, "You know, son, we we have this investment property and it's not really doing much and I I think I want to sell that investment property." And the son goes, "Oh, dad, I really don't think we should. I've been looking forward to having that property." And the father says, "Well, it's my property. I I I want you to go ahead and sell it." And the son didn't sell it. He just chose not to. Now the question is how many times did the son submit to his father? Most people would say he submitted to the father twice. But the answer is he submitted to the father zero times. Why do I say he submitted to the father zero times? Because he only did what he agreed to. And when you only do what you you agreed to, then you're not submitting to the other person. Right? The first time it was take out some money and give it to your kids. I agree to that, so I'll do it. The second one was take some money out and give it to your mother. I agree to that. Third time, sell the property. I don't want to sell the property. I'm not going to do it. If he didn't want to do the other two things, he wouldn't have done those either because he wasn't in submission to the father. He wasn't in submission to his father. So, I step back and I say, when the Bible calls a wife to submit to her husband, it's not just do what you agree to. It's actually listen to the leadership of your husband. You say, "Well, I don't trust him right now. I'm struggling with trusting him because he wasn't a good leader for a while." Okay, I understand that. That's why he is the one with the bigger responsibility because his responsibility is to lead you well. So I would say this to him. You have a responsibility to live with your wife in an understanding way to love her as Christ loved the church and to lead her as the spiritual leader of the home. You have a big responsibility. But that responsibility given to him doesn't change your responsibility to submit to him in every area. The Bible says to submit to him in all things. So my encouragement to you is to recognize those two things. It's hard. It's not easy. But you know what? Those two areas are probably the areas you're fighting the most. You don't want to submit to him and he doesn't want to live with you in an understanding way. So my two encouragement to you is to look at those passages. Get those books we mentioned and um if you have a pastor in your life and I pray that you do maybe seek out someone a third party him your pastor or someone else in the church who can offer up a counseling for the two of you to help you to grow together and get back on the on the place where you need to be because you said you were there at one time and you've grown away from that. I pray that you would get back to it. All right, last one and we are going to be done.
--------------------------------------------------
[2:22:20] Should I leave a church over singing songs from Bethel, Elevation, etc?
Answer: >> Okay. I'm in a bit of a tough situation with my church. It's not a reformed church, although many of the pastors are Calvinistic, and they play songs by Bethl, Elevation, and Hill Song, who I'm sure you're aware all come from movements that promote false teaching. I'm part of the worship team at my church and I've recently told the worship leader that I no longer feel comfortable playing songs by those groups as it feels like we're promoting the churches that play these songs. I'm planning on meeting with him in person as well as my pastor to discuss my concerns more. I have a good idea that I'm going to ask them, but I'm interested in hearing your thought opinion on what I should ask them. If they refuse to stop playing songs by these groups, should I leave the church? I have a great church family there and our doctrine is very sound and biblical, but I'm just not sure if I can continue to go to a church that promotes these groups. >> Okay. Um, this is an area where I I I sort of have mixed opinions and not not that not not that I'm mixed on Bethl or Elevation or Hill Song. I think they're all garbage and I think their teaching is bad and I don't think it should be promoted and I don't think it should be sung in churches and we try not to sing those songs at sovereign grace. When I say we try not to I'm I'm sure at times maybe one or two has made its way in so I don't want to say we've never done it but we certainly don't try to do it. Can we can you repeat the question? No, we cannot. Uh but thank you for asking. Um but here here's the thing. uh you you were a part of the worship team and you stepped down because you didn't want to continue to to to play these songs and I I I think that's the best thing to do if it's bothering your conscience. But I really struggle with someone leaving a church over this unless the unless the songs are specifically theologically in error. That's where I think it would be a real issue for me. Um, I understanding who wrote a song and and where the song came from, that can be bad and I do think it is bad and I don't think it should be promoted. But at the same time, if I'm in a loving church that's preaching the gospel and seeking to do everything right and this is the one area that they're failing in, I don't think that I would allow that to let me leave. I think I would have a conversation with my elder and I think that's what you said you want to do. And the conversation would begin basically basically with this. It would need to start this way. Elder, pastor, whoever it is you're talking to, I want you to know that I love you and I'm not being accusatory. I'm not trying to create division and I'm not trying to sew dissension among the body. But I do have a question. Why is it that we think that it's good to promote these bands? Why is it that we can't find better songs and better bands and better music to choose from? because so many of these bands are promoting a false gospel even if the music they they write has some good lyrics and just see what they say. They might say, "You know what? It's not a big deal. We just don't think it's a big deal." And at that point, you can maybe express that to you, you feel like it is a big deal. But at the same time, I really would have a hard time if you're in a church that loves you, loves your family, and is preaching the gospel. I don't think I would walk out over this. But I would have this conversation. So my recommendation is have the conversation and begin with that. What is it? Why are we doing this? And is there not a better way? Is there not a better way? And and and again go to them in the heart of love and the heart of saying I'm not here to create division or dissension. I'm not here to sew discord. I really am here to hopefully try to to help you understand my heart on this. And um and so that's that's the way I would I would go. I would go remember this. Proverbs 15:1 says, "A soft word turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up division." So if you go and you go with a harsh word, why are you so dumb to be playing Bethl songs? Don't you know how dangerous that is? That's going to create division. That's going to create dissension. But if you go in and you say, I just have a question. Why do we think this is a good idea? And is there not a better way? That would be the way I would approach it. And so that's that's my thought. Guys, I think that's going to be where we end tonight. Did was there something else you wanted to mention? >> Uh, Cap says, "Happy New Year, y'all. Stay safe and blessed." >> # don't feed the stupid. That's going to be the hashtag for January. The hashtag for January. >> Before you leave, let's pray for him because he says he might have the flu or cold. >> All right, let's do that. And and uh and we'll close out with a prayer. All right. Father, we thank you for this opportunity. It's been a long two and a half hours, Lord. My eyes are getting heavy, but I'm thankful to get to talk about your word. I'm thankful to get to talk to your people, and I'm thankful to get to minister alongside my wife. And I pray, Lord, that this has been a blessing to those who have listened to it. And I pray pray especially for Jim, Lord, that you would raise him up, keep him from being too sick, Lord, and even grant him healing in accordance with your will, that he might be able to be uh be able to enjoy his new year and and not be under the weather. And father, we thank you for him being a a consistent uh person in our audience and a consistent part of our chat group. And we just pray that you bless him and continue to strengthen him as well as all the others, Lord, who are listening. Lord, be with them till we meet again. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. >> Amen. >> All right, guys. Thank you so much. Happy New Year. We will see you >> next year. >> May God bless you all and good night. >> Good night. Sometimes I feel the weight of the world fall down on me and I need a friendly voice with some good theology. So I mix a manly drink. Then I hit the YouTube link and I feel my troubles all melt away. Oh, it's your Calvinist podcast with Keith Fi. Beards and bow ties, laughs till sunrise. It's your Calvinist podcast with Keith Fi. He's not like most Calvinists. He's nice. Your Calvinist podcast with Keith Fosski. Striving for superior theology and denominational unity, one joke at a time. >> Not so fast, preacher man. Behold, it is I, Horus, Egyptian god of the sun. And while you all believe that you've been celebrating the birth of your Lord Jesus,
