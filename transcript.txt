[00:23] half-finished or not even started. And

[02:14] Live from the Theo Shed in beautiful
[02:17] Callahan, Florida, it's Tuesday night.
[02:27] >> Sometimes I feel the weight of the world
[02:31] fall down on me so heavy.
[02:35] And I need a friendly voice with some
[02:38] good
[02:41] speaking. So I mix a manly dream that
[02:44] seems shoe punish and I hit the YouTube.
[02:48] Don't say hit that sounds violent and I
[02:50] feel my troubles all melt away. Oh,
[02:56] it's your podcast with Ke
[03:04] and
[03:07] laughs till sunrise.
[03:10] It's your Calvinist podcast with Keith.
[03:17] He's not like most Calvinist these
[03:21] nights.
[03:24] Your Calvinist podcast is filmed before
[03:26] a live studio audience.
[03:30] And welcome back to Your Calvinist
[03:32] Podcast. My name is Keith Foski and I am
[03:35] your Calvinist. And with me as always is
[03:38] the beautiful, intrepid, and always
[03:39] faithful, Mrs. Your Calvinist, Jennifer
[03:41] Fosski. Good evening.
[03:43] >> Hello. Hello. Hello.
[03:45] >> And it's good to see everyone out there
[03:46] in the comments. People were commenting
[03:49] all day today letting us know they were
[03:51] going to be on tonight. So, we're
[03:52] grateful to see you guys. First comment
[03:54] today came in at 11 o'clock.
[03:56] >> Wow.
[03:57] >> 11 o'clock this morning. It was uh let's
[03:59] see. Fast Eddie said, "If you're not
[04:01] first, you're last." That's right. So,
[04:04] uh good to see you guys. Uh uh good to
[04:06] have everyone with us tonight. I want to
[04:09] let you know just a quick uh quick
[04:11] little little technical issue here. If
[04:13] you do hear a fan blowing tonight, it is
[04:16] because we are in the Theo shed and it
[04:18] is 40° here in Florida, which I know for
[04:22] those of you up north, 40°, you're like,
[04:24] you know what?
[04:24] >> Wearing short sleeves.
[04:25] >> Still wearing short sleeves. No problem.
[04:27] But in Florida, it's a little bit cold
[04:30] for us. So, we have our little space
[04:32] heater running right behind us because
[04:34] the Theo shed, even though it does have
[04:36] spray foam insulation. The Theo shed
[04:38] does not have a heater. It has a window
[04:41] unit, air conditioner, but no heater.
[04:42] So, we are living off of It's 39
[04:45] degrees, man.
[04:46] >> Yeah.
[04:47] >> This is 39 degrees. Just to show where
[04:49] we are here in the world. All right.
[04:52] >> 40 degrees. I'm wearing shorts.
[04:54] >> Yeah. Yeah.
[04:56] So, it's good to see everyone tonight.
[04:58] We had we were uncertain if we were
[05:00] going to be able to do this week's show
[05:02] because we have had a very busy two
[05:05] weeks. We have we decided at Christmas
[05:08] time during my little Christmas holiday
[05:11] to remodel our kitchen and in hindsight
[05:16] not a great plan. It was
[05:19] >> it's been difficult. Uh tensions have
[05:22] been high in the Fosski house. It's been
[05:25] a little bit of a uh a test of our
[05:27] sanctification.
[05:29] Not for Jennifer, of course. She's
[05:30] perfect. But for me, it was a test for
[05:33] my sanctification, but I think we've
[05:35] made it through it okay so far. We still
[05:37] got a few things we need to do. We have
[05:40] our appliances coming tomorrow. And once
[05:42] the appliances are in, I am going to
[05:43] snap some pictures and share some photos
[05:45] of the work that we have done so far.
[05:48] But then we've got to put in some
[05:49] baseboards on the new cabinets. I've got
[05:51] to have our my friend Steve's going to
[05:54] come and help me frame up a pantry wall
[05:57] and door or new pantry. Once that's
[05:59] done, we'll take some new pictures and
[06:02] show everyone what our new kitchen looks
[06:03] like. But that's that's what I've been
[06:05] doing. So, if you've been wondering why
[06:06] we haven't had a golf cart video or we
[06:08] haven't had a lot of new videos, I've
[06:10] been kneede in remodeling my house, but
[06:13] we've still been putting out short
[06:14] videos. You guys have been watching
[06:16] them, commenting on them, and uh and I
[06:18] thank you for that. And we said we
[06:20] didn't want to miss a week of questions
[06:22] because if we missed a week of
[06:24] questions, we'd be so far behind. I
[06:25] don't think we would ever we'd ever be
[06:27] able to get our way out of it. We would
[06:29] be so upside down. So, we have tons of
[06:31] questions to get to tonight for Tuesday
[06:33] Night Live. And this is the last live of
[06:36] 25. That's what we're calling tonight.
[06:38] It is our last live show. And I just
[06:42] want to say this, and I'm sure Jennifer
[06:43] will agree with me. We have been so
[06:45] grateful for how many of you have
[06:47] supported us. This has become the
[06:49] cornerstone of Your Calvinist podcast
[06:51] and it was never intended to become
[06:53] this. Uh your Calvinist podcast for
[06:55] years was a weekly interview show where
[06:57] I interviewed people and I still do
[06:58] interviews. I did several dozen
[07:00] interviews this year. But this weekly
[07:03] show has become the foundation. And we
[07:07] looked at the numbers and we're just so
[07:09] grateful for all of you guys who have
[07:10] been watching who have been supporting
[07:12] the show. It's an opportunity every week
[07:15] for us to share the gospel, to answer
[07:17] questions that you have about the Bible,
[07:19] theology, and about ministry. And we're
[07:22] just grateful that we get to be a part
[07:24] of your lives and to be a part of the
[07:27] the ministries that are going on out
[07:29] there in the world that that pastors are
[07:32] sending us questions, pastors wives are
[07:33] sending us questions, church members are
[07:35] sending us questions, and we're just
[07:37] grateful to God. We're grateful to you
[07:40] and we just want to say again what a
[07:42] wonderful year that it has been and we
[07:44] look forward to going even stronger in
[07:46] the new year. But I do have an important
[07:47] question as we get into the new year and
[07:52] my question is what are some of your
[07:55] suggestions uh tonight I want to ask
[07:58] about about what what it is you would
[08:02] like for this show? Any changes that you
[08:04] think would make this show better? Uh
[08:07] Jennifer and I have talked a lot. Um we
[08:10] love the questions that we get.
[08:12] Sometimes the questions are really long
[08:14] and intense and it's hard to read them
[08:16] all on the show, we're not always able
[08:17] to do that. And you guys know that. And
[08:19] probably my biggest difficulty is
[08:21] sometimes the the questions are so long
[08:23] it's hard to even know what the question
[08:25] is. And so that would be my one thing I
[08:28] would ask is when you send in your
[08:29] question, be very clear what you're
[08:31] asking so that we can be clear with our
[08:33] answer. I'm not watching the comments.
[08:36] You're You're laughing. What's going on
[08:37] over there, Jennifer?
[08:38] >> Suggestion. A puppet show.
[08:39] >> A puppet show.
[08:41] Hello. Hello.
[08:47] Hold on. This kind of looks like a
[08:49] puppet. Be like,
[08:51] "Hey,
[08:55] a mic."
[08:56] Actually is a mic. It's a It's a
[08:58] microphone. Nice. That's so dumb. I'm
[09:02] sorry. An official moderator would be
[09:04] good. I I agree. Mary is our unofficial
[09:07] moderator. We'll work on getting that
[09:08] done. I know we've said we were going to
[09:10] do it. I know we've said so and I know
[09:12] we haven't done it yet, but we are going
[09:14] to do that. In fact, I'll write that
[09:16] down. That is a that is a good thing
[09:18] that we need to do. An official
[09:20] moderator.
[09:22] Something else we are going to be doing,
[09:23] we are going to be reinvigorating our
[09:25] shirt shop. Uh this is something that
[09:27] Jennifer is taking the taking the reigns
[09:30] on. We're going to be giving some some
[09:32] new opportunities for some t-shirts for
[09:35] the new year. Several people asked about
[09:37] buying shirts and we do have a t-shirt
[09:38] shop over at Teespring, but we haven't
[09:40] had a great deal of a great experience
[09:42] with them. So, there's another company
[09:44] that we're looking at and uh it's uh
[09:47] actually the shirt I should have wore
[09:48] tonight. I wore Superman, but I I got a
[09:51] new shirt from my favorite YouTuber.
[09:53] Yeah. Yeah. I'm not my own favorite
[09:54] YouTuber. My favorite YouTuber is a guy
[09:56] named Distracted Nerd. He breaks down
[09:58] movies and you guys know how much I love
[10:00] movies and so Jennifer went to his merch
[10:03] store and bought me a shirt for
[10:05] Christmas and we've been looking at his
[10:07] merch store and we think we're going to
[10:09] give that a try. So be watching out for
[10:12] when some of our we're going to have
[10:13] some actual your Calvinist shirts that
[10:14] are going to come out. We're going to
[10:15] have some of our sayings like I hope it
[10:17] was a blast for them because it was
[10:19] certainly a blasphemy. We're going to
[10:20] get that shirt remade. We're going to
[10:21] make some other shirts with some of the
[10:23] funny things that we have. Maybe we'll
[10:25] have a shirt that says if you have a
[10:26] problem call Mary. That'd be funny.
[10:28] >> Mary's here. Quiet now.
[10:30] >> Yeah. Your Calvinist podcast. If you
[10:31] have a problem, call Mary. All right.
[10:34] >> Okay. I like this this idea. The Muppets
[10:36] by denominations.
[10:38] >> Oh, man. Didn't I do a Muppet? I did a
[10:40] Muppet uh show. If the Muppet If Muppet
[10:43] characters were churches, I did that.
[10:45] Look up Look that up on the channel.
[10:47] There is a If Muppet characters were
[10:48] churches because I remember Fozzy was he
[10:51] walks into a church, he goes, "This
[10:53] don't look like Presbyterians to me." I
[10:55] remember that particular clip. That was
[10:57] funny. And that's my Fozzy, by the way.
[10:59] By the way, super.
[11:00] >> Thank you, Michelle.
[11:01] >> A nice I see super chats are already
[11:05] coming in. I want to say thank you to
[11:07] everyone who has already done that. You
[11:08] want to bring him up, Jennifer, real
[11:09] quick.
[11:09] >> And shout out real quick. Dan Kase is in
[11:12] >> Dan Kase is in the house. Dan Kase is
[11:13] one of my favorite people in the world.
[11:15] And he of course is a member of
[11:16] Sovereign Grace. It's good to see you
[11:17] out there tonight, Dan. Um, this is from
[11:20] Bill Anderson. Jen, you want to read it?
[11:22] >> I appreciate your ministry. It has
[11:23] helped me as I've served the last few
[11:26] months as an interim pastor of the
[11:27] church where I've been a youth pastor
[11:29] for three and a half years was just
[11:31] confirmed as the next senior pastor.
[11:32] Would appreciate your prayers.
[11:34] >> Awesome. Well, let's pray for Bill right
[11:35] now. I also want to say I just think
[11:37] he's so much cooler than me. Look at
[11:39] those jeans he's wearing in his in his
[11:41] in his in his profile picture. He's
[11:42] wearing jeans and a sport coat. Man,
[11:45] he's sharp. He's a sharp looking cat.
[11:47] We'll go. We're going to pray for Bill
[11:49] and pray that uh pray that God would
[11:50] bless his ministry. So, let's do that.
[11:52] Father, I thank you for giving me the
[11:54] opportunity to minister to Bill in what
[11:56] little way that I have through this show
[11:57] and Jennifer and I as well. And I just
[11:59] pray Lord that you would raise him up
[12:01] within his church to be a wonderful
[12:03] leader for his people. That he would be
[12:04] a shepherd who smells like sheep. That
[12:06] he would be among his people. That he
[12:08] would love them well. That he would
[12:09] teach the word of God rightly. And Lord,
[12:11] that you would bless him and fill him
[12:13] with your spirit as he goes to proclaim
[12:14] your word each Lord's day. And father,
[12:17] as he goes through the difficulties of
[12:18] ministry and the inevitable problems
[12:20] that are going to arise and arise in all
[12:22] ministries, I pray Lord that you would
[12:23] undergard him, strengthen him, and walk
[12:25] with him through all of them, knowing
[12:27] Lord that you are the source of all of
[12:29] his strength as you are the source of
[12:31] any of the strength that we have. And we
[12:33] thank you, Lord, for all this. And we
[12:34] pray for Bill in Jesus name. Amen.
[12:37] >> Amen.
[12:37] >> All right. Well, thank you again for
[12:40] sharing that, Bill. We appreciate it.
[12:41] And uh the rocks or who's that? The
[12:44] rocks tube. Is that a new a new person?
[12:46] He became a new member. Wonderful. Thank
[12:48] you for joining the uh the Superior
[12:50] Theology Club. We appreciate that and we
[12:52] appreciate the uh the donation tonight.
[12:56] Very very generous. We appreciate that
[12:58] very very much.
[12:59] >> Hey, Michael Foster is out there says he
[13:02] has arrived and uh I hope you had a
[13:05] wonderful Christmas. I saw a wonderful
[13:07] picture. Did you see the picture of him
[13:08] with his with his he had his his kids
[13:10] and they had the candy cigarettes?
[13:12] >> No.
[13:13] >> It was real cool. I thought that was a
[13:14] sharp point.
[13:14] >> I appreciated his substack.
[13:16] >> Yeah. Hey, shout out to Michael. Uh he
[13:19] wrote a really good article and I and I
[13:22] I feel like it was aimed directly at me.
[13:24] So, I just want to say, Michael, I know
[13:25] who you I know you were talking about me
[13:27] when you were talking about all these
[13:28] pastors who are out there chasing
[13:30] chasing likes and chasing uh uh internet
[13:33] influence. I hope you know I'm kidding a
[13:36] little bit. No, seriously, I really like
[13:38] the article. made a very good point and
[13:41] I appreciate the fact that in the
[13:42] article he did say it's good for a
[13:44] pastor to have an online presence. It's
[13:45] good to do these things, but that it
[13:47] should not neglect, is always you, we
[13:50] shouldn't neglect pastoring and
[13:51] ministering to our own local churches.
[13:54] And uh if anybody hasn't seen his
[13:56] article, uh I know Jennifer shared it, I
[13:58] shared it, uh some folks in our church,
[14:01] uh brother Adam had shared it. So uh go
[14:04] check it out and uh it be be a good
[14:06] read, especially for those of you who
[14:08] are in the ministry. There are some
[14:09] really dangerous ditches that we walk by
[14:12] and one of the ditches is seeking
[14:14] popularity and so we have to be careful
[14:16] with that.
[14:17] >> Look, Keith
[14:18] >> A,
[14:18] >> you do a good job.
[14:19] >> Well, thank you, Michael. I appreciate
[14:21] it and I appreciate your encouragement
[14:22] as always. You're a good friend,
[14:24] brother. And appreciate you being out
[14:26] there. All right, guys. So, uh, want to
[14:29] get to our questions pretty quickly here
[14:31] because we have a bunch. But before we
[14:32] go anywhere, we always want to make sure
[14:34] that at the beginning of the show, we
[14:36] give the gospel. And why do we give the
[14:38] gospel? Well, because one, number one,
[14:41] we don't know how many people who are
[14:42] listening tonight are actually believers
[14:44] yet. Number two, even if you are a
[14:46] believer, it's always good to be
[14:47] reminded of the gospel. And number
[14:50] three, somebody might come across this
[14:51] one day by accident. And if nothing
[14:53] else, they hear from this show, I would
[14:55] want them to hear about the Savior, the
[14:57] Lord Jesus Christ, and the only way that
[14:59] anyone has ever been or will ever be
[15:01] saved, and that is through faith in
[15:03] Jesus Christ. And why is that? Who is
[15:04] Jesus? Well, Jesus is the son of God. He
[15:06] came into the world to save sinners. The
[15:08] Bible says in the fullness of time, God
[15:10] sent forth his son, born of a woman,
[15:12] born under law, so that he could redeem
[15:14] those who are under the law and give
[15:16] them the adoption as sons. See, Jesus
[15:18] came into the world as the only begotten
[15:21] of the father, the the the son of God.
[15:24] And because he lived a righteous life
[15:27] and he died a substitutionary death, he
[15:30] actually pays the penalty for our sin.
[15:32] And he provides for us an opportunity to
[15:35] trust in him and be saved. His blood
[15:39] covers our sin and his righteousness
[15:41] becomes our righteousness. That way when
[15:44] we stand before God, our sins are
[15:46] completely forgiven and our
[15:47] righteousness is not our own, but it
[15:49] comes from the Lord Jesus Christ. And so
[15:52] tonight, if you're out there and you
[15:54] haven't trusted in the Lord Jesus
[15:55] Christ, here's a condition you're in.
[15:56] You're a sinner. You have offended God.
[15:59] And because of your sin, you deserve
[16:00] God's punishment. But God being rich in
[16:03] mercy provided a way of escape. He
[16:05] provided a plan of salvation. And that
[16:07] plan is through his son. And if you
[16:09] would turn from your unbelief, trust in
[16:11] the Lord Jesus Christ, the Bible says
[16:14] you will be born again. You will
[16:16] actually have a changed heart. And that
[16:19] changed heart will result in a changed
[16:21] life. And if that's never happened to
[16:24] you before, I want to I want to pray
[16:25] that God would open your heart to
[16:27] believe and that through that you would
[16:30] start to follow the Lord Jesus Christ
[16:33] and that it would not only be something
[16:35] that happens today, but that it would go
[16:37] into your whole life. That would change
[16:39] everything about who you are. Because
[16:41] when we have an encounter with Jesus
[16:42] Christ and he changes us, everything
[16:45] changes. And uh and if if if this is
[16:48] something that is new to you and you
[16:50] want to know more, you have questions
[16:52] about your soul, please send us a
[16:53] message. Go to keithfoski.com, send us
[16:56] an email, and let me know that this is
[16:58] about your soul and you're concerned
[16:59] about your soul. And those folks who are
[17:01] concerned about their soul, well, they
[17:03] go to the top of the list because we are
[17:05] most concerned about you. All right, so
[17:09] message us if you need. All right,
[17:12] Jennifer, got a lot of questions to get
[17:14] to tonight. Anything going on in the
[17:16] comments before I have to uh

[17:26] >> It's hard to do both. But the best way
[17:29] to get your question to make sure that
[17:31] it gets answered is to go to keith
[17:32] keithfoski.com and submit it that way.
[17:35] We try to pick up the comments, but
[17:36] >> now we won't get to it tonight.
[17:38] >> That's the only thing. Oh yeah. If I if
[17:40] you go to email us tonight, just know
[17:42] that we have already printed off the the
[17:44] questions for tonight and we get
[17:46] questions literally every day. So, we
[17:48] print off the questions throughout the
[17:50] week. We we we curate them, put them on
[17:53] this list, and by Tuesday afternoon, we
[17:55] have this list ready to go. So, if you
[17:57] send us an email today, it will be on
[17:59] next week's show. That's
[18:00] >> Michael Foster wants a song.
[18:02] >> I want He wants He wants a song. Um,
[18:06] I don't I don't I don't quite know
[18:09] >> what song.
[18:10] >> Is there a song that has the name Foster
[18:12] in it? No. Is there a song with the name
[18:16] Michael in it?
[18:19] >> No, it doesn't matter. I don't know. We
[18:20] have to
[18:22] I had to have to move on from that. Uh,
[18:24] I don't have a good joke for that. Okay.
[18:26] One other thing. Uh before we get to the
[18:28] questions, I do want to remind everybody
[18:29] that just last week we had our meme the
[18:32] halls competition and it was wonderful.
[18:35] It was a blast and uh we we have already
[18:38] named the winner of the meme the halls
[18:40] competition. In fact, if you were not
[18:42] here and didn't get to see this was the
[18:44] meme that won it all, it was this meme
[18:47] right here. James White waiting for
[18:49] Keith to bring him a burger. And if you
[18:51] don't know what that means, if you don't
[18:53] know why that's funny or why that would
[18:55] have win won the contest, then you don't
[18:57] know the lore of your Calvinist podcast
[19:01] because that's a deep part of your
[19:02] Calvinist lore. Also, uh we had several
[19:05] others that that that got honorable
[19:07] mentions. This one here about Mary,
[19:09] anti-calvinist crusader, overzealous
[19:11] Calvinist enjoyer, and Mary coming in
[19:13] with the bat to protect the chat. And
[19:16] then of course, I really like this one.
[19:18] This one made me happy. says, "When
[19:19] you're arguing with a friend about
[19:20] theology and you find out that Keith
[19:22] Fosski agrees with you, big smile." I'm
[19:25] gonna start using that one. I love it. I
[19:27] love it. All right, guys. You ready to
[19:29] get to the questions? Jennifer, you
[19:31] ready to get to the questions?
[19:33] >> All right, let's make it happen.
[19:35] >> All right, first one out of the gate and
[19:37] we are at 1938.
[19:41] >> Holy moly media appears to have went out
[19:43] of business. Do you know of a
[19:44] replacement?
[19:46] >> Oh boy. Uh, this is actually not I
[19:48] didn't only get this question from one
[19:50] person. I've gotten this question from
[19:51] several people. And for those of you who
[19:54] don't know what Holy Moly Media is, a we
[19:57] got a a a super chat from Michael. That
[20:00] was very nice. Um,
[20:02] >> we'll look at it.
[20:03] >> Holy moly media was a company that sold
[20:07] movies that had been edited for content.
[20:09] So, all the bad language, all of the any
[20:12] if there were any nude scenes or
[20:14] anything like that, it cut all that out.
[20:16] and anything that was ultraviolent or
[20:17] anything. So much so that we have we
[20:19] have Die Hard from Holio Media and and
[20:23] my kids have seen it because it it it
[20:25] take took out all the all the stuff that
[20:27] was that that that you wouldn't want
[20:29] your kids to hear or see. Yeah, it's
[20:30] only about 30 minutes long, but we love
[20:32] it.
[20:32] >> Um it's funny because
[20:35] >> that's the way that I actually
[20:39] >> that was the way I was introduced to
[20:40] most movies when I was a kid. I didn't
[20:42] we didn't we didn't get most of our
[20:44] movies on VHS or on CDs or DVDs. Most of
[20:49] our movies came through Saturday
[20:50] afternoon television. And when something
[20:52] was played on network television, it was
[20:54] edited for TV. It had the bad words
[20:56] taken out. Any nudity taken out,
[20:58] ultraviolent stuff was taken out. That
[21:01] was how movies were made for television.
[21:03] It was and it said it says this movie
[21:05] has been edited for television. And now
[21:09] you can't get that anymore. You can't
[21:11] watch movies because nobody has cable
[21:13] anymore. Nobody has network television.
[21:15] Everybody has Netflix and all the other
[21:18] streaming services. So, Holy Moly Media
[21:21] was a company that provided edited
[21:23] versions like you would get on
[21:24] television. Unfortunately, they have
[21:27] gone out of business and I advertised
[21:29] for them. I had them I had a whole video
[21:31] I made about them because I really loved
[21:33] their product. But
[21:36] it is no more. So, the question is, is
[21:40] there a replacement? As of right now, I
[21:43] know not of any replacements for Holy
[21:45] Milly Media. The closest thing you're
[21:47] going to get is Vid Angel, and it's Vid
[21:50] Angel's got a lot of problems. I I Vid
[21:53] Angel has very a lot of limits on what
[21:57] it is able to to to
[22:00] do. Uh because it can only do certain
[22:03] movies, it can only do certain uh
[22:05] streaming services. So, Vid Angel is not
[22:07] a great option. We had it for a while,
[22:10] but we we let it go because we we just
[22:12] didn't use it.
[22:13] >> So, as of right now, my answer is no. As
[22:16] of as of right now, I'm bummed because I
[22:18] can't point you to a better resource.
[22:20] But, as soon as one comes available that
[22:22] I know about that I find out about, I
[22:24] will get it to you. And if anybody out
[22:26] there if anybody out there knows of a
[22:31] better resource, something like Holy
[22:32] Moly Media, and here's my here's my
[22:34] challenge. Maybe we should all write
[22:37] letters to the movie companies because
[22:40] if the movie companies would produce the
[22:43] clean versions like they did for
[22:45] television, the the made for TV
[22:47] versions, I would buy them. If it was
[22:49] available from Universal Pictures or
[22:52] Paramount or one of these other
[22:53] companies, if they had the movies
[22:55] available and it wouldn't take them a
[22:56] minute to edit the movie out, they did
[22:58] it for the the for the network showing.
[23:02] For me, it would be the most awesome
[23:03] thing and I would be happy to pay
[23:05] Paramount or Universal, whoever was the
[23:07] parent company to do that, but
[23:09] unfortunately, as of right now, it's not
[23:11] available.
[23:12] >> Uh, Clear Play does filters for movies.
[23:14] That That is one I have heard of, and
[23:16] I'm Thank you. Thank you for reminding
[23:17] me of that. Solomon,
[23:21] >> uh, we'll just put it up on the screen.
[23:23] Everybody else can guess how to say
[23:24] that. Um, Clear Play does filters for
[23:27] movies, but I've never I've never tried
[23:31] it, so I can't I can't endorse it. But I
[23:34] will I'll put a note here for Clear
[23:35] Play, and we'll we'll give that a look,
[23:37] and if it turns out to be good, we'll uh
[23:39] we'll endorse it. All right, that is it
[23:42] for question number one. Jennifer, let's
[23:44] move on to question number two. 23:45.
[23:48] >> Okay.
[23:50] Greetings, Brother Keith. I attend your
[23:52] Sunday service via YouTube every week. I
[23:54] live in Klay County, Alabama. I was
[23:57] wondering if it's okay to attend your
[23:58] online sermons and be consider
[24:01] considered part of y'all's wonderful
[24:02] congregation.
[24:04] I do sometimes attend a local
[24:06] congregation and have looked at a few
[24:08] more, but reformed seems to be a unheard
[24:11] of. In closing, in closing, I want to
[24:13] hear the word, not the world. Thank you
[24:16] for your time, and SGFC is in my
[24:18] prayers. Well, first of all, I want to
[24:20] say that I am I'm I'm glad that our
[24:23] church is ministering to you online, but
[24:27] this this this is important and I really
[24:29] want to be as as as forthright as I can.
[24:33] There there's no way for you to be a
[24:35] functioning part of our body when you
[24:38] live literally on the other side of the
[24:40] United States. You you you are, didn't
[24:43] they say California, Klay County,
[24:45] California, Alabama or or Alabama still?
[24:47] you're several states away.
[24:50] I
[24:52] I I know that it can be it can it can it
[24:57] can be nice to to to have good solid
[25:00] theology coming to you through the
[25:01] internet, but that doesn't make the
[25:04] experience you're having what what you
[25:06] should be having on the Lord's day in a
[25:08] local church. So, I want to pray that
[25:10] God will will lead you to a local church
[25:13] in your area. And and and I and I just
[25:16] want to say again, you cannot be a
[25:19] member of a church that you're not able
[25:21] to be a part of. Because part of
[25:24] membership in a church is not just
[25:25] listening to the sermons and enjoying
[25:28] the service. But part of membership in a
[25:30] church is that God gives you spiritual
[25:33] gifts to use within the body. And God
[25:35] gives other people spiritual gifts to
[25:36] use within the body. And those spiritual
[25:38] gifts work together in building up the
[25:41] body. And right now, you're not able to
[25:44] be a part of our body. As much as it
[25:46] might feel like you're a part because
[25:47] you're able to watch online, you're not
[25:49] able to really be a part. And as much as
[25:52] we appreciate you and as much as we love
[25:54] you, you're you're not able to really
[25:56] join the church that way. That's not the
[25:59] way it can function. And so I just want
[26:03] to say to you, one, I'm thankful that
[26:05] the ministry has been a blessing to you,
[26:07] but please don't consider an online
[26:09] ministry to be your church. It's I it's
[26:13] it's it's supposed to supplement what
[26:16] you're getting from a local church. It's
[26:18] not supposed to be a replacement for
[26:21] your local church. So, I pray that God
[26:23] would open the door for you to find a
[26:26] local church in your area. Know that we
[26:28] appreciate you. We we appreciate your
[26:29] prayers and we do appreciate you
[26:31] watching, but just don't let what we're
[26:33] providing through the internet to be
[26:35] something that replaces a local church.
[26:38] That's just not healthy for you,
[26:39] especially um in the long in the long
[26:42] run. It just wouldn't be good for your
[26:44] soul. And I care about your soul enough
[26:46] to tell you that it's just not good for
[26:48] you to to replace the local body with an
[26:52] online church experience.
[26:54] Uh and and and again, we're going to
[26:57] pray for you that God will help you find
[26:59] a local church. All right. Uh thank you
[27:02] again for sending that in. Let's move
[27:04] on, Jennifer. I'm trying to we got quite
[27:06] a few to get to tonight. So, moving
[27:08] moving along. We're now to question
[27:10] number three.
[27:12] >> Someone said in the comments, "Move to
[27:13] Callahan, Florida." And that would solve
[27:15] the
[27:15] >> Yeah. Yeah. Now, again, you're only in
[27:17] Alabama. I thought you're in California.
[27:18] I misheard. Uh you're in Alabama. That's
[27:21] about 12 hours away. move over to
[27:24] Jacksonville.
[27:26] Actually, don't do that. Don't do that.
[27:28] I mean, not that we would wouldn't want
[27:29] to have you, but
[27:32] moving moving for a church can also be
[27:34] bad because we we we might not be all
[27:36] that you think that we are. That's that
[27:38] that's another thing. I've had people
[27:39] who who've, you know, oh, I'd love to be
[27:42] a part of your church and then come find
[27:43] out that we're just a we're church.
[27:45] We're just a regular church. I mean, we
[27:46] have problems. We have issues. We're not
[27:49] perfect. So, uh that that definitely
[27:51] happens.
[27:53] Real quick,
[27:55] >> Ether, your beard is amazing. Any tips
[27:56] on beard grooming and maintenance?
[27:58] >> Oh, that is that is that really? Okay,
[28:01] first of all, Jedi, you make me feel
[28:02] good because I I was real close to
[28:04] trimming it way short today.
[28:07] >> I've been so hot and so tired from or
[28:09] working on the I said exercising. No,
[28:12] working on the my exercising is running
[28:14] that skill saw, baby.
[28:15] >> You were doing a lot of exercising.
[28:17] >> I've been up and down a lot. But no, uh
[28:19] uh my beard my beard maintenance routine
[28:21] is I wash my beard with the same stuff I
[28:23] wash my hair with and I brush it with a
[28:26] brush. That's all that's I don't I don't
[28:28] have a I don't have a routine. I just
[28:29] happen to be a hairy fellow. And so
[28:31] here's what I do. I use my hairbrush to
[28:35] brush.
[28:36] >> And then we see
[28:36] >> my beard.
[28:37] >> Where's my hairbrush?
[28:39] >> Oh, where is my hairbrush?
[28:42] Oh, where is my hairbrush?
[28:45] Oh well, well,
[28:47] you know, the guy who does Veggie Tales
[28:49] has turned out to be kind of a weird
[28:51] guy.
[28:52] >> Yeah.
[28:52] >> Yeah. Phil Viser, is that his name?
[28:54] >> He's like all all woke now. I don't like
[28:57] that at all.
[28:59] >> All right. Somebody say something about
[29:00] the Harbor Freight bucket behind me if
[29:01] anybody hasn't noticed it. Harbor
[29:03] Freight right there. That's that's all
[29:05] the stuff that's going to our our first
[29:06] prize winner. I haven't got a chance to
[29:08] get it to him yet, but I am.
[29:11] All right. Uh
[29:14] We We need to change the time because we
[29:16] got off on the on the beard thing. Let's
[29:19] Let's go now. It is 2920.
[29:21] >> Squirrel.
[29:22] >> Squirrel.
[29:23] >> Go ahead, Jennifer.
[29:25] >> Ask the question
[29:25] >> all over the place.
[29:27] >> Okay. Pastor Keith, thank you first of
[29:29] all for taking the time to answer these
[29:31] questions. My elders have asked me
[29:33] several times to lead the Bible study
[29:35] during our Wednesday night prayer
[29:36] meeting and Bible study. As a lay member
[29:39] of the church, I've been hesitant to
[29:40] call the lessons I've delivered from the
[29:42] pulpit on Wednesday nights sermons. My
[29:45] question is, what distinguishes a lesson
[29:47] from a sermon? Am I drawing a
[29:49] distinction where there really isn't
[29:51] one? Is my hesitancy to call it a sermon
[29:54] unfounded?
[29:55] >> Okay, this is a great question, and this
[29:57] is actually one that there's some debate
[29:59] over. So I want to I want to be I want
[30:02] to I want to be
[30:04] open enough to say that my answer may be
[30:07] different from the way other people may
[30:09] answer this. Uh but all I can do is give
[30:11] you what I think. People say is there a
[30:13] difference between a lesson and a
[30:14] sermon? Yes. What is the difference
[30:15] between a lesson and a sermon? Well a
[30:18] lesson is about about
[30:22] imparting information. It's about
[30:24] teaching you something you didn't know.
[30:26] There there's there there's something in
[30:29] a sermon that is what we call the
[30:31] sermonic thesis or the the uh and now uh
[30:37] uh part of the sermon. You know, now
[30:40] that you've learned this and now we
[30:42] should we should respond in some way. A
[30:47] lesson doesn't necessarily
[30:49] call for a response, but a sermon should
[30:52] call for some kind of response. Even if
[30:53] the response is to um to recognize your
[30:57] God and worship him, right? That that
[30:59] that should call for a response. Or if
[31:01] the if the response, it's not always
[31:03] like a gospel response like turn from
[31:05] your sin and trust in Jesus. But the the
[31:07] the the gospel is part of the message,
[31:09] right? Trust in Christ is is is should
[31:13] be coming out in our sermons. Trust in
[31:15] Christ and believe his gospel, right?
[31:18] That should be part of our sermon. And
[31:20] that's not always part of a lesson. I
[31:22] can give a lesson on the history of
[31:26] textual variation in the New Testament
[31:30] Greek manuscript tradition, right? And
[31:32] and I could give an entire lesson on
[31:34] that without there ever being an and now
[31:37] moment or so what moment, right? But
[31:39] that's why that would not ever be a
[31:41] sermon. Now, now in my sermon, I might
[31:43] talk about textual variation. And I have
[31:45] like in my sermons, in fact, in just a
[31:47] few weeks, I'm going to be in John 8 and
[31:49] I'm going to be talking about John
[31:50] 7:53-811, which is one of the major
[31:53] textual variants of the New Testament.
[31:54] And I'm going to have to include that in
[31:56] my sermon. But that's going to result in
[31:58] an and now moment, right? There's going
[32:00] to be somewhere in the sermon where I
[32:02] say, "Now that you have heard this and
[32:03] now we we respond, right? A response
[32:06] moment." So, so that's one of the things
[32:08] I think we need to consider is when we
[32:13] when we talk about what distinguishes a
[32:14] sermon from a lesson, a lesson doesn't
[32:17] have to have a call of response, but a
[32:19] sermon should a sermon should not end
[32:21] with just when there's the facts. Do
[32:23] with them what you want, right? No,
[32:25] there should be. And and here is what
[32:26] God wants us to do with this. Here's
[32:28] what God is calling us to do as a result
[32:31] of this. So, that that's that's part of
[32:33] it. The other part of it is um when you
[32:37] are when you're when you're teaching or
[32:40] you're preaching they are going to flow
[32:43] together. So when people say is
[32:46] preaching teaching or is teaching
[32:47] preaching all preaching should have an
[32:50] element of teaching and um but not all
[32:53] teaching necessarily is going to be
[32:55] preaching that again goes back to the
[32:56] call on response. So, it really depends
[33:00] if if if there's no reason why a layman
[33:03] can't preach a sermon. You said you're a
[33:06] layman in the church and you're
[33:08] wondering if you are if if if if what
[33:11] you're doing on Wednesday nights from
[33:12] the pulpit should be called sermons. My
[33:15] answer is if you're preaching from the
[33:17] pulpit on a Wednesday night and it's a
[33:19] service, it's a sermon. And and and if
[33:22] it's a sermon, it should have some kind
[33:23] of a call to respond. And that would be
[33:26] the distinction. If you're just teaching
[33:27] a lesson like on the history of the the
[33:30] the the a certain doctrine or something,
[33:33] it may just be a lesson, but at the same
[33:35] time like on Wednesday nights, I teach
[33:37] lessons. I don't really do sermons as
[33:40] much on Wednesday nights, but there
[33:42] there's still even within that there's
[33:43] still preaching that happens. So,
[33:46] there's a lot of bleed over. There's a
[33:47] lot of there's a lot of
[33:50] there's a lot of uh there's just a lot
[33:54] that that that that that
[33:56] is is united between both of those. So,
[34:01] um but I don't think you I don't think
[34:03] you should have any fear of calling what
[34:04] you do a sermon because if you're up
[34:08] behind the pulpit preaching or speaking
[34:10] from God's word to God's people, you're
[34:12] explaining the text. Here's all a sermon
[34:13] is by the way. you you uh you read the
[34:15] text, you explain the text, you apply
[34:18] the text. That's what a sermon is. If
[34:20] you're doing that, that's that's a
[34:21] sermon. That's a sermon. And and again,
[34:23] it comes back to that application. And
[34:24] so what and now um somebody said, "Call
[34:28] it a sermonet." Yeah. All right. Um
[34:32] okay, let's uh that great question.
[34:35] Let's move on. The next one is a
[34:37] historical question. I think it's a
[34:38] great one. Let's go ahead and move on to
[34:40] the next question. 3440. And then can we
[34:42] talk about Metropolis, Illinois? This is
[34:44] what we've been talking about in the
[34:45] comments.
[34:45] >> Well, we can stop right now. I'll mark
[34:48] out that number and we'll come back to a
[34:49] second. I know I'm wearing a Superman
[34:51] shirt and somebody Go ahead, read.
[34:53] >> I explained them. If Keith wants to meet
[34:55] the real Superman in Metropolis, that
[34:56] would be Brother Jack Russell, my pastor
[34:58] growing up and mentor to one Paul
[35:00] Washer.
[35:01] >> That's awesome.
[35:02] >> But she lived in the city Metropolis,
[35:06] Illinois. Like the real museum there.
[35:08] >> Really? Well, that's I know there's a
[35:11] Superman museum. I I didn't know where
[35:13] it was, but that but that that's really
[35:15] cool. That's really cool. They have a
[35:17] big Superman festival in June. A
[35:18] Superman statue. Superman museum.
[35:23] I think we're going to go to where is
[35:24] it? Illinois. I think we're going to go
[35:26] to Illinois in June and and enjoy the
[35:28] Superman festival. That would be
[35:30] awesome. Uh,
[35:33] funny enough, I'll tell you a quick
[35:35] story. I I'm a Superman fan. You can
[35:38] tell, you can look up here, you'll see a
[35:39] bunch of Superman figurines. There's a
[35:41] there's a three-foot Superman statue
[35:43] over there. I am a Superman fan.
[35:46] >> But when I was a when I was a kid, I was
[35:48] a Superman nut. Like I I I collected
[35:51] comic books. Love the movies. I I can
[35:54] Yeah, I can quote all the Christopher
[35:56] Reeves movie. Chris Reeve is the
[35:58] greatest Superman of all time. Don't
[35:59] come at me. You won't win. Uh I know
[36:02] Henry Caval's beautiful. All you people,
[36:04] oh, look at Henry Caval. He's so
[36:05] handsome. He's so beautiful. And I say
[36:06] that with an unblenmished record of
[36:08] heterosexuality. He is a beautiful man,
[36:10] but he is not Christopher Reeves.
[36:12] Christopher Reeves is the greatest
[36:14] Superman ever. And again, don't come at
[36:16] me. I know what I'm I know what I'm
[36:17] about. So anyway, having said all that,
[36:23] when I was in
[36:25] probably uh 8th grade, my dad decided we
[36:30] were going to go to
[36:33] Washington DC. And while we were going
[36:36] to Washington DC, he told me we were
[36:38] going to visit the Smithsonian. And at
[36:39] the time, we thought there was a
[36:41] Superman exhibit in the Smithsonian.
[36:44] >> We walked all through the Smithsonian
[36:46] Museum. Never got to any Superman
[36:48] exhibit. So I was disappointed
[36:51] all of the amazing things that exist in
[36:54] the Smithsonian Museum. And I was
[36:56] disappointed because there was not a
[36:57] Superman exhibit in the Smithsonian. So,
[37:00] if there is a Superman exhibit in
[37:02] Metropolis, Illinois, I want to go
[37:05] because I was disappointed when I was a
[37:08] teenager. All right, guys. That's my
[37:11] thoughts. You ready to move on?
[37:14] >> Yes.
[37:15] >> Okay. You know, we got some really long
[37:16] questions later. Uh, I don't know how
[37:19] much of we're going to read, but we'll
[37:20] get there.
[37:22] >> Okay. I read this claim in a social
[37:24] media post. I can't remember if they
[37:26] claimed that the idea of an erit seed
[37:28] didn't come around till the 19th or 20th
[37:31] century.
[37:33] >> Okay, this is one of those times where
[37:37] someone will claim
[37:39] something and there may be truth to the
[37:43] claim but the claim is is is
[37:47] arguing too much. Okay. So the claim is
[37:51] that inherency
[37:54] is a recent doctrine. Inherency is a
[37:58] recent doctrine. What is inherency?
[38:00] Inherency says that the Bible is without
[38:04] error in everything that it says. That's
[38:07] the doctrine of inherency. And
[38:12] people will say, well, that the ancient
[38:14] people understood that the Bible made
[38:16] mistakes when it came to the numbers of
[38:18] people or the people understood that the
[38:20] Bible made mistakes when it when it was
[38:22] when it when it said things about how
[38:24] many tribes did certain things or how
[38:27] many people were in certain tribes or
[38:28] these things or they were using round
[38:30] numbers and things like this. And the
[38:31] argument is that the doctrine of
[38:34] inherency
[38:36] is applying a a modern and even uh
[38:42] a a unnecessary rigidity on the text
[38:48] that forces it to say well to to to to
[38:52] be absolutely precise in everything that
[38:55] it says. And the argument goes that
[38:58] that's not the way that ancient writers
[39:01] would have would have written. That's
[39:04] not the way it would have been
[39:05] understood. So that's a modern
[39:07] imposition upon the text. I don't agree
[39:10] with that. I'm just saying that's sort
[39:11] of the that's the argument is that the
[39:13] is that inherency was not something that
[39:16] was argued about in the ancient world.
[39:18] That's not that it was it's it's a
[39:20] recent argument. And and here's again my
[39:22] answer. There is some truth to that in
[39:24] the sense that the term inherency is
[39:26] relatively recent and the and the idea
[39:28] of rigid or a rigid inherency is is
[39:31] relatively recent. But the Bible clearly
[39:36] proclaims that it speaks the truth.
[39:39] Jesus himself says, "Sanctify them by
[39:41] thy truth. Thy word is truth." Right?
[39:45] And so if you argue that the Bible has
[39:48] errors, what you're saying is that the
[39:50] Bible has falsehoods. And if you read
[39:53] through the church fathers and you read
[39:55] through the reformers and you read
[39:57] through all the people who lived prior
[39:58] to the 19th century, you'll find that
[40:00] they claim that the Bible speaks the
[40:02] truth. The Bible says the truth. And so
[40:05] to argue that inherency is a later
[40:07] doctrine. Well, the the the the term and
[40:10] the use of language may be a later
[40:13] developed idea. But the idea that the
[40:16] Bible speaks the truth and says what is
[40:18] true is not a recent idea. This is
[40:20] something that was held by Christians
[40:23] throughout the ages who have believed
[40:24] that the Bible and is true and what it
[40:27] says is true. Now there is something
[40:30] that we have to consider and this is why
[40:32] I believe the Chicago statement on
[40:33] biblical inherency is important because
[40:35] when we talk about biblical inherency we
[40:37] have to consider the fact that there are
[40:41] textual variations and there are
[40:43] manuscript discrepancies and things that
[40:45] that raise questions about certain
[40:48] portions of certain texts. But that
[40:51] doesn't mean that the Bible as it was
[40:53] written contained errors. But what it
[40:55] means is that through the centuries
[40:57] through scribal amendations and uh
[41:00] scribal errors and scribal uh changes
[41:03] there have been things that have been
[41:05] introduced into the text that now we
[41:06] have to look at and we actually have to
[41:08] evaluate the history of the text based
[41:11] on the evidence that we have from the
[41:13] manuscripts. But that's not the same as
[41:15] saying that the Bible is uh was written
[41:18] with errors. And this is why like in our
[41:19] statement of faith at our church, it
[41:21] says the Bible is inherent in its
[41:24] original autographs. Meaning the
[41:26] original writings when John sat down
[41:29] to write the gospel of John. The Bible
[41:32] says he was carried along by the Holy
[41:35] Spirit. The Holy Spirit superintended
[41:37] the writing of scripture. Therefore, if
[41:40] the Holy Spirit is superintending the
[41:42] writing of scripture, then we can be
[41:44] confident that John got it right, that
[41:46] he actually wrote the truth. Now, are
[41:50] there again, are there places where
[41:52] there are textual variations which cause
[41:54] some issues? I I was listening to RC
[41:56] Sproul today and he was talking about
[41:58] how there's actually one manuscript
[42:00] somewhere that talks about Goliath not
[42:02] being 9 foot tall, but being 6 foot
[42:05] tall. And Goliath wouldn't have been uh
[42:09] very imposing if he was only my height,
[42:12] right? He wouldn't have been that
[42:14] frightening if he was only 6' tall. But
[42:16] that's a variation. That's not what we
[42:20] would say is part of the original
[42:22] manuscript. And so we don't have to
[42:24] consider that to be a viable variant. So
[42:27] these are all things that come in into
[42:29] the question of inherency. But if
[42:30] someone says that inherency is a modern
[42:33] idea, I would say the language that we
[42:35] use for rigid inherency probably is a
[42:38] modern a modern way of looking at it.
[42:42] But the church has always
[42:44] agreed when I say the church
[42:46] historically church fathers, middle u uh
[42:49] medieval church writers and into the
[42:52] post-reformationational church have all
[42:54] agreed that the what the Bible says is
[42:56] true. What the Bible says is true. And
[42:59] so that's that's where I hang my hat. I
[43:04] believe that what the Bible says is
[43:06] true. Could there be variance introduced
[43:09] through scribal errors and things
[43:11] throughout the the the centuries? Yes.
[43:13] And those have to be evaluated based
[43:14] upon the evidence. But it doesn't mean
[43:17] that I can't trust what my Bible says.
[43:19] So that's a simple answer, but I
[43:21] hopefully it's one that that is helpful.
[43:24] Um, when someone says inherency didn't
[43:26] come along until the 20th century or the
[43:28] 19th century, the language, yes, but not
[43:30] the concept.
[43:32] All right, let's move on to the next
[43:35] question.
[43:37] >> Okay,
[43:37] >> I'm going to turn this heater off. It's
[43:39] hot.
[43:43] >> All right, Miss Jennifer, let's go.
[43:45] >> Referencing 2 Corinthians 7:10, can
[43:48] believers have godly sorrow and worldly
[43:50] sorrow? Like when you first sin, you're
[43:53] you're struck by worldly sorrow, then
[43:55] quickly recognize that and see that it's
[43:57] wrong, and then you're led to godly
[43:59] sorrow.
[44:01] Yeah. Um I preached through 2
[44:03] Corinthians two years ago. Uh I I I
[44:06] think I spent 18 months in 2 Corinthians
[44:09] and I remember preaching this particular
[44:11] passage and I talked about the fact that
[44:14] uh worldly sorrow is experienced by
[44:17] everyone. Uh it's godly sorrow. It's God
[44:20] godly sorrow that leads to repentance.
[44:23] Your question is, can a believer have
[44:25] both? Yes. I think a believer can
[44:27] experience a form of worldly sorrow even
[44:30] though they're a believer because we're
[44:32] not completely sanctified. There are
[44:33] times when I don't have the sorrow I
[44:36] should have, the godly sorrow that leads
[44:38] to repentance because I'm still
[44:40] struggling with that particular sin in
[44:42] my life and I'm not uh yet fully
[44:45] repented of it. Right? And so, yes, I
[44:47] think the answer uh can a believer have
[44:51] worldly sorrow? Yes. And here's here's
[44:53] an example. Jennifer Jennifer counsels
[44:56] with me. We we actually do provide
[44:58] counseling at our church in different
[45:01] contexts. And a lot of times Jennifer
[45:03] will will will counsel along with me.
[45:04] She's trained as a counselor as well.
[45:06] And so, um, we have both experienced
[45:09] where we are counseling Christians and
[45:12] that Christian is dealing with a
[45:13] particular sin and yet they're not ready
[45:16] or willing to repent of that sin.
[45:18] They're still struggling in the sense of
[45:20] struggling with it, but they're really
[45:21] not because they're still engaging in
[45:23] it, right? they're still they're still
[45:24] loving that sin and and and so having to
[45:27] call them to repentance, having to call
[45:29] them to recognizing that sin. Uh is is
[45:33] part of what brothers and sisters are
[45:35] supposed to do when someone is, as
[45:38] Galatians says, if your brother's caught
[45:39] in a a transgression, you know, rebuke
[45:42] him, right? Go and and and restore him
[45:44] if he if he repents, right? But why do
[45:46] you have to rebuke him? Because he
[45:48] probably has not yet felt that godly
[45:49] sorrow, right? The rebuke is what helps
[45:52] bring about the godly sorrow hopefully,
[45:55] right? Maybe he feels the worldly
[45:57] sorrow, but it's not leading him to
[45:58] repentance. Godly sorrow leads to
[46:00] repentance. So yes, can a believer feel
[46:04] worldly sorrow and godly sorrow? Yes.
[46:06] But our prayer is that is that we would
[46:08] feel godly sorrow that leads to
[46:09] repentance whenever it we're engaged in
[46:12] any kind of sin. So So that's um I guess
[46:15] a simple answer to a to a pretty heavy
[46:18] question. That makes sense.
[46:19] >> Yeah. Yeah, I think we can probably move
[46:21] on from there. That that was a a good
[46:23] question. Uh not don't have a lot to add
[46:25] to it except that um
[46:29] if if if I were if I were dealing with
[46:31] someone, I might point that out to them.
[46:33] If someone came to me and and or or if I
[46:36] recognized someone was in sin and I
[46:37] called them out on it or rebuked them
[46:38] for it or I or I, you know, tried to
[46:40] counsel them on it and it and it was
[46:42] obvious they had some sorrow but no
[46:45] desire to change, I might say to them,
[46:47] you are you're you're demonstrating
[46:50] worldly sorrow, but godly sorrow leads
[46:53] to repentance. So, um so that's that
[46:58] that would be that that that would be
[47:00] something I would want to point out to
[47:02] them. In fact, I want to just real quick
[47:03] here since we're since we went through
[47:06] this one a little bit quickly. I want to
[47:07] I want to look at something real quick
[47:09] here. Jennifer, tell them that joke, you
[47:11] know.
[47:13] >> Oh,
[47:13] >> just kidding.
[47:15] We have a joke around the house. So,
[47:17] Jennifer does have great Yeah. Right
[47:18] here. Uh 2 Corinthians 7:10 says, "For
[47:22] godly grief produces a repentance that
[47:24] leads to salvation without regret,
[47:26] whereas worldly grief produces death."
[47:28] Yes. Um well in this case it's referring
[47:30] to someone who is unwilling to repent.
[47:33] They have worldly grief over their sin
[47:35] because sin always has consequences,
[47:37] right? But they don't repent. The
[47:39] believer repents, but can a believer
[47:41] experience worldly grief in that there
[47:43] there's a time where they're unwilling
[47:45] to repent? Yes, I think that that could
[47:47] be the case, but it might not be to the
[47:49] extent that Paul's referring to there in
[47:50] that passage. Uh so yes, I think it
[47:54] would still be a form of worldly grief
[47:56] until such time as they actually do uh
[48:00] repent of that sin.
[48:03] All right. Somebody says, "Tell us tell
[48:05] us what what did I miss? You watching
[48:08] the comments?"
[48:09] >> I I must have missed that.
[48:11] >> Okay.
[48:14] >> All right.
[48:15] >> Okay.
[48:16] >> All right. Let's move on. We uh we got
[48:18] plenty more questions. When in doubt, I
[48:19] should play paper rock scissors. Shoot.
[48:22] >> That's right.
[48:23] >> That's from us.
[48:23] >> Yeah. Paper rock scissors. Everybody
[48:26] gets mad because I don't say rock paper
[48:27] scissors. It's paper rock scissors.
[48:28] >> Paper scissors.
[48:29] >> It's paper rock scissors. Paper comes
[48:31] first.
[48:32] >> Paper rock scissors.
[48:35] All right,
[48:37] Jennifer, let's go to next question,
[48:39] please.
[48:40] >> Love you guys. I'm a big fan of short
[48:42] and sweet questions. So, here goes.
[48:44] We're big fans of that, too.
[48:47] are believing that the great tribulation
[48:48] was in 70 AD and all millennialism
[48:51] mutually exclusive trying to work out
[48:53] this whole esquetology thing has me
[48:55] really wore out.
[48:56] >> All right, great question and I'll make
[48:58] this a simple answer. The answer is no.
[49:01] The they are not mutually exclusive. You
[49:04] can believe that the the the the belief
[49:06] that the great tribulation occurred in
[49:09] AD70 is uh known as part what's known as
[49:14] a predtoistic view of the great
[49:16] tribulation.
[49:18] And uh I'm what's known as a partial
[49:21] predtoist amillennialist which means
[49:24] that I believe that the et discourse at
[49:27] least much of the et discourse was
[49:30] looking forward to the destruction of
[49:32] the temple in AD70. Even though there
[49:34] are portions of the Olivet discourse
[49:35] that I think looked forward to the final
[49:37] second coming of Christ, I I believe
[49:40] there was a dual fulfillment that there
[49:42] was the immediate fulfillment of the the
[49:45] um destruction of the temple in AD70 and
[49:48] then of course that there was a uh there
[49:50] is coming a final fulfillment in the
[49:52] return of Jesus Christ at the end of the
[49:54] age. And so, uh, I if you're asking, can
[49:59] can an amalennialist believe that the
[50:02] the great tribulation occurred in AD70?
[50:04] Answer is yes, because I believe that,
[50:05] and I am the king of the Amalennials.
[50:08] So, yeah. In fact, I shouldn't I should
[50:09] have brought my crown. Jennifer bought
[50:11] me a crown for Christmas. It's
[50:12] beautiful. So, it says king of the
[50:14] Amalennials on it. Um, so yes, can a
[50:17] person believe that? I will say this,
[50:19] it's not the majority report among
[50:22] Amillennials. uh it tends to be more the
[50:24] position of the postmillennial crowd.
[50:26] Most of them hold to a partial
[50:27] predtoistic view. But this is where I'm
[50:30] sort of an odd duck is I'm a partial
[50:32] predtoist amalennialist. But yes, you
[50:35] can hold to amal millennialism doesn't
[50:36] demand that you hold a particular
[50:38] position on when the great tribulation
[50:40] takes place other than the fact that
[50:41] most amalists would say that there is
[50:44] tribulation all through the church age
[50:46] or all through the millennium which we
[50:48] are in right now. And I would agree with
[50:50] that. I would agree with it being a um
[50:52] an ongoing tribulation that the church
[50:56] experiences. The even the Lord Jesus
[50:58] Christ told us that you know in this
[50:59] world uh we're going to experience
[51:02] tribulation. Paul says in this world you
[51:03] have trouble or Jesus said in this world
[51:05] you have trouble but take heart I've
[51:07] overcome the world. So um those are th
[51:10] those are the some of the differences
[51:13] but in general we talk about the great
[51:16] tribulation. We're talking about uh what
[51:19] happened to Jerusalem in AD70. That that
[51:22] at least is the uh fulfillment I believe
[51:24] of much of the ET discourse.
[51:27] All right.
[51:29] So, uh let's move on to the next
[51:33] question.
[51:33] >> Okay. The context for this question.
[51:36] There is a church I'm familiar with that
[51:38] has only had to my memory the Lord's
[51:41] supper three times in 26 years. I'm not
[51:44] aware of a specific p passage that
[51:46] dictates how frequently we are to
[51:48] partake of the elements, but this seems
[51:50] to be sinful neglecting of the means of
[51:52] grace. The reasons given for why this
[51:55] was not common practice was fear and
[51:57] some would unworthy unworthily partake
[52:01] and that nothing in the Bible says how
[52:03] frequently we are to partake of the
[52:05] Lord's supper.
[52:07] Okay. So the question is when does
[52:10] neglect of the Lord's supper become
[52:11] sinful? When does neglect of the Lord's
[52:15] supper become sinful? Well, if your
[52:17] church has only done
[52:20] the Lord's supper three times in 26
[52:25] years.
[52:26] >> Wow.
[52:27] >> Yeah. That's sinful. I I I I
[52:31] and I say that not I'm not pulling that
[52:34] out of thin air. I am telling you that
[52:38] while a case a case can be made that you
[52:42] don't have to do it every week. We do it
[52:43] every week. A case could be made that
[52:46] it's not required for every week. Even
[52:48] though I believe we should. I believe
[52:50] the model of the early church is to
[52:52] participate every week. But a case could
[52:54] be made that that's not required. But
[52:57] three times in 26 years means you have
[52:59] held back the Lord's supper. The very
[53:03] picture of the gospel, the very means by
[53:06] which Christ demonstrates his sacrifice
[53:10] before the people of God, the bread and
[53:12] the cup. You have you have had people
[53:14] come and go from your church and who
[53:17] have served and lived and loved there
[53:19] for years and never tasted of the bread
[53:22] or drank of the cup.
[53:25] In 26 years, if you've only done it
[53:27] three times, it's possible that that
[53:30] several people, dozens of people may
[53:33] have come and gone and not tasted of the
[53:35] Lord's supper at your church. Yeah, I
[53:36] would say that's wrong. I would say
[53:38] that's sinful. I would say that's sinful
[53:40] neglect. We I if your church had not
[53:43] sung
[53:45] worship songs to Jesus and to the Lord
[53:49] uh the triune God, if your if your
[53:51] church had not sung songs in 26 years, I
[53:54] would say that's wrong. I would say
[53:55] that's that's that's neglect of duty. If
[53:58] your if your pastor had not preached a
[54:01] sermon
[54:02] only three times in 26 years, I would
[54:04] say he was derelct in his duties.
[54:08] If your church had not administered
[54:11] baptism
[54:13] more than three times in 26 years,
[54:16] I would say unless unless there was some
[54:19] extenduating circumstance where there
[54:21] was just no one around to hear the
[54:22] gospel and be saved, I would say that
[54:25] was that that would be incredibly
[54:28] uh uh in inconsistent with what a church
[54:32] is supposed to be doing. So, yes, if you
[54:34] tell me your church has not taken
[54:36] communion but three times in 26 years, I
[54:37] have to say that's sinful. I have to say
[54:39] that's sinful. Um,
[54:41] and so how often should a church do it?
[54:44] We're not given an absolute. Jesus says,
[54:48] "As often as you do this, do this in
[54:49] remembrance of me." But we do know this.
[54:52] The early church met on the first day of
[54:55] the week. And they met for for according
[54:58] to Acts chapter 2. They met uh uh to uh
[55:03] for the apostles doctrine, for the for
[55:06] the fellowship, for the breaking of
[55:08] bread and for the prayers and and the
[55:11] breaking of bread is not just eating a
[55:14] meal together, but it was the language
[55:18] of the table. I believe the early church
[55:20] when they met they had the agape feast
[55:23] which was or sometimes referred to the
[55:25] agape feast or the agape feast the they
[55:27] had the the meal together and with that
[55:30] meal they took bread and they said this
[55:31] is this bread represents Christ's body
[55:33] this is my body they would pass it out
[55:35] this is my blood they would they would
[55:37] pass out the cup and they would eat it
[55:38] they would drink it in remembrance of
[55:40] what the Lord did and to not do that
[55:43] would have been odd to them it would
[55:46] have been uh something that was out of
[55:49] place to worship together and not have
[55:52] the Lord's supper. So, yeah, I think
[55:55] it's not good at all. Not good at all.
[55:59] >> Well, let me throw this up here real
[56:00] quick. Scott says, "Hey, Foskies, tell
[56:03] Stephanie congrats for putting up with

[57:13] >> Yep. We we straddle April Fool's Day, so
[57:16] we always have fun on our birthdays.
[57:18] Ashley's March 31st and I'm April 2nd.
[57:21] >> Congratulations, Keith. Your wife has
[57:23] put up with you for 27 years.
[57:24] >> Actually, she's put up with me for 29
[57:26] years. We met each other. Well, 20 28
[57:29] years. We met each other on October 26,
[57:32] 1997 in Ryan Steakhouse on Merill Road
[57:34] in Jacksonville, Florida. I saw the most
[57:37] beautiful girl I'd ever seen wearing a
[57:40] red V-necked velvety shirt with a pair
[57:43] of blue jeans, white sneakers. She had
[57:45] her hair pulled back in a ponytail and
[57:48] uh and I remember looking at her brown
[57:51] eyes and she watched me do a magic trick
[57:53] for her and she thought it was pretty
[57:55] cool. And that was very surprising to me
[57:57] because no girl had ever thought I was
[57:59] cool up until that point. And uh I said,
[58:01] "I've got to I've got to grab hold of
[58:03] this one because she thinks I'm cool.
[58:07] And uh and it worked out. Yeah.
[58:13] >> All right, guys. Uh
[58:14] >> I missed Ryan Steakhouse. I would love
[58:17] Ryan Steakhouse. That would be that
[58:19] would be awesome.
[58:21] All right, let's uh let's do a couple
[58:23] more before we take a break. We we've
[58:25] got several.
[58:26] >> We're rolling.
[58:27] >> We are rolling. Uh we are at 5830.
[58:32] What's the best and loving response for
[58:34] us to give to those who are constantly
[58:36] setting rapture dates, particularly the
[58:39] ones who keep setting dates that come
[58:40] and go?
[58:43] Thump them in the forehead.
[58:47] No. Um, honestly, I don't hear this as
[58:51] much as I used to. I used to see this
[58:53] all the time. I mean, with Harold
[58:54] Camping,
[58:56] I did a sermon uh one time called
[58:58] Camping on Dangerous Ground. This was
[59:00] back when Herold Camping was really
[59:02] really out there making making bold
[59:05] claims about the return of Christ. And I
[59:07] just talked about the danger of his
[59:09] ministry and what because he he not only
[59:11] was he date setting but he was
[59:12] encouraging people to leave their
[59:14] churches and that the the uh the
[59:17] institutional church was dead and people
[59:19] needed to people need to leave the
[59:20] churches. They needed to listen to him
[59:22] because he was the voice of family radio
[59:23] and you need to listen to him and he
[59:26] would show you the way. And many people
[59:28] did and they followed many of his wild
[59:32] and very eccentric uh uh claims to
[59:37] knowing exactly when Jesus was going to
[59:39] return, knowing when the rapture was
[59:40] going to happen. And uh he was wrong and
[59:42] he ended up he ended up passing away.
[59:45] And he has to give an account for all
[59:47] the false prophets, all the false claims
[59:49] that he made and and and uh false state
[59:52] setting that he did. So, uh, the best
[59:55] and loving response for us to give those
[59:56] who are constantly setting rapture
[59:57] dates, ignore them. Tell them, "I'm not
[60:00] interested. This is you have no idea
[60:02] when Jesus is going to return. You are
[60:04] not going to make the claim and get it
[60:07] right. And I'm not concerned about your
[60:10] foolish ramblings. Just I I said this a
[60:14] while back. I said this actually I said
[60:15] this at Michael Foster's conference.
[60:17] Somebody said, "What do you what do we
[60:19] do with all these people, you know,
[60:21] online that are saying crazy things?" I
[60:22] said, "Don't feed the stupid." Right?
[60:24] Just don't feed the stupid. Don't give
[60:26] in to the stupid. Right? Just Just tell
[60:29] them, "I'm not interested. I'm not going
[60:31] to I'm not going to deal with this. I'm
[60:32] not I'm not giving you my attention. I'm
[60:34] not giving you my time." Um and as far
[60:38] as the people who sets the set dates,
[60:40] they come and go.
[60:42] Mock them.
[60:44] I mock them. This is this is one of
[60:46] those times where you you you're
[60:48] claiming you know when Jesus is going to
[60:49] return and you're wrong. And I make
[60:54] videos making fun of him because I this
[60:57] is one of those times where I feel like
[61:00] Elijah Mount Carmel when you you mock
[61:03] the the prophets of Baal,
[61:05] >> right? Uh but but the best the best
[61:08] thing and probably easiest thing you can
[61:09] do just ignore them and and don't let
[61:12] them bother you because they don't know.
[61:14] They the guys are well I did math and I
[61:17] came up with the 69 weeks and the and
[61:19] the and the the gap between the 69 and
[61:21] 70th week and we're about to enter
[61:23] Daniel's 70th week and blah blah blah.
[61:25] And it's like you are such a chatter
[61:28] head. You don't know.
[61:30] just hush
[61:32] and um just don't give them don't either
[61:34] don't give them your attention or uh
[61:36] mock them until your throat is sore.
[61:38] That's my recommendation.
[61:42] All right, let's uh let's move on.
[61:45] >> Okay, how much of this do you
[61:47] >> Okay, I forgot this is this is one of
[61:50] the we we got several long questions
[61:52] this week and this is one of them and
[61:54] this one has some personal stuff in the
[61:57] question. So, um, maybe I should just
[62:00] explain it.
[62:01] >> Yeah.
[62:02] >> Because the question is, does giving
[62:04] forgiveness mean essentially that you
[62:07] have to continue to receive abuse?
[62:10] >> And the person wrote in and said,
[62:11] "Pastor Keith, forgiveness by God
[62:13] requires repentance. Even the change of
[62:15] heart is given by God. But we're
[62:16] required to forgive even those who don't
[62:21] when there is no repentance." I have
[62:22] some I have an issue with that, and I
[62:23] want to I want to bring that up, too.
[62:24] But we'll go back to that in a second.
[62:26] Um, but he goes on to basically say uh
[62:31] that that
[62:33] they're living with a family member who
[62:35] is
[62:37] not not physically or mentally abusive
[62:40] but just is very difficult to to deal
[62:44] with. This person has gotten older and
[62:46] as a result they are struggling with how
[62:50] to confront this person and should they
[62:52] confront them or just keep forgiving
[62:54] them? That's that's really the heart of
[62:55] the question. when you say is should
[62:56] they confront them or should they just
[62:58] keep forgiving them?
[62:59] >> And um but but but first I do want to
[63:02] address this thing because this was
[63:03] actually a big debate online a few weeks
[63:05] ago
[63:06] >> and I didn't engage with it because at
[63:08] the time I just didn't have the
[63:09] bandwidth to deal with it and I almost I
[63:11] thought about making a golf cart video
[63:12] about it and I might one day. Um maybe
[63:16] it'll be maybe I'll do one before the
[63:17] end of the year because yeah I've only
[63:19] got a day.
[63:20] >> Yeah. Um but the question of are you
[63:24] know this person says we are required to
[63:26] give forgiveness even if there's no
[63:29] repentance. I think you need to stop
[63:34] just short of that and I want you to
[63:36] think of this. Are we and and and and I
[63:39] know there's going to be controversy
[63:40] about this and I know some of you going
[63:41] to to argue. Some of you are even going
[63:43] to say Keith you're wrong. You're 100%
[63:45] wrong. and and and on this I think you
[63:48] need to listen and hear me before you
[63:50] automatically assume that what I'm
[63:51] saying is what you think I'm saying.
[63:55] If I were to say
[63:58] that we are required to forgive everyone
[64:00] who repents to us. I I think that's
[64:03] clear from scripture because Jesus says
[64:05] if if if your brother sins against you
[64:07] and he repents, you forgive him. If he
[64:10] sins against you seven times and comes
[64:11] to you and says I repent, you forgive
[64:12] him. We are we are commanded to to
[64:15] forgive everyone who repents. But if a
[64:18] person is unrepentive, if a person is
[64:21] unwilling to repent, are we required to
[64:24] forgive them? And here's where I think
[64:26] the issue rises with this. I think we're
[64:29] required to be
[64:32] ready to forgive them. I think we're
[64:34] required to stand ready to forgive them.
[64:37] But I think that forgiveness is
[64:39] transactional. meaning I think there for
[64:41] that person to receive forgiveness there
[64:44] has to be a a something on their part
[64:46] that receives it and that that is their
[64:49] coming and receiving that forgiveness
[64:51] and so if someone says well I forgave
[64:53] this person who hurt me okay well I
[64:55] think what you mean is that you stood
[64:57] you're standing ready to forgive them
[64:59] but until that person has repented until
[65:01] that person has come seeking
[65:02] reconciliation there's no real
[65:06] giving of the forgiveness because
[65:07] they're not receiving it yet right
[65:09] that's the point I'm making is is it's
[65:10] it's transactional. There there's
[65:12] there's something missing. Now, what you
[65:15] shouldn't do is you shouldn't be bitter
[65:17] and angry and holding back your
[65:19] willingness to forgive. But I think like
[65:22] the prodigal son, here's here's an
[65:23] example I'm going to give. The father of
[65:24] the prodigal son stood ready to forgive
[65:27] his son, right? He stood there waiting,
[65:30] looking for his son to come. And when
[65:32] his son came, he ran to him and he
[65:34] lavished him with forgiveness. He
[65:35] clothed him uh with the, you know, he
[65:37] put his garment on him. He put his ring
[65:39] on him. He gave him everything, right?
[65:40] Like he stood ready. But but the son had
[65:43] to come back, right? Jesus said if your
[65:45] if your brother sins against you and he
[65:46] returns and repents seven times, you you
[65:48] forgive him, right? So So the the point
[65:51] I'm making is is I I don't think
[65:54] forgiveness is completed without the
[65:56] other person's participation. I don't
[65:59] think I think I think we can stand ready
[66:01] to repent. I'm sorry, ready to forgive,
[66:03] but until there is action on the other
[66:05] person's part, um there there is I think
[66:09] it's it's not fully forgiven. There's
[66:12] not it's not fully completed. And so
[66:14] some people might say I'm splitting
[66:16] hairs there and say, "Well, we've
[66:17] forgiven them, but they haven't received
[66:18] the forgiveness." Okay, however you want
[66:19] to however you want to claim it. I'm
[66:21] just saying I remember one time RC
[66:24] Sproul talked about this because this
[66:25] was this was another aspect of it that I
[66:27] think is often overlooked. He said, he
[66:31] said, "Let's say a man steals your
[66:32] watch, right? And and and he comes to
[66:34] you and he says, "I'm I'm sorry for
[66:37] stealing your watch, but he's still
[66:39] wearing the watch and he's not going to
[66:40] give you the watch back."
[66:43] RC Sproul said, "That man's not forgiven
[66:46] because he's still wearing my watch,
[66:47] right?" Like like like like like he's
[66:49] still there like he's still doing it.
[66:50] Like the the transaction would be he
[66:53] takes the watch off and gives it back.
[66:54] But as long as he's wearing that watch,
[66:56] there's there's there's something
[66:57] missing here, right? there's something
[66:59] that this transactional loop hasn't
[67:01] closed, right? And so that that's that's
[67:04] kind of a a part that I think uh a a way
[67:09] that I think people miss um when we talk
[67:13] about can you forgive someone who
[67:15] doesn't repent. You can stand ready to
[67:18] forgive and you can offer forgiveness
[67:19] and you can tell them I forgive you, but
[67:22] until they receive it and I and they
[67:23] receive it through repentance and
[67:25] reconciliation, I think there's still an
[67:26] open loop that hasn't closed. That's
[67:28] that that's
[67:29] >> that's something that and and that's not
[67:31] really the question that you asked but
[67:33] it is something that I think needs to uh
[67:36] uh
[67:37] needs to needs to at least have been
[67:39] said. Um and so that that's that's a
[67:44] that's not answering your question but
[67:45] like I said that's part of of all this
[67:47] as far as your question.
[67:50] Um
[67:53] what what can you do? you you the main
[67:56] thing you asked in this and again I
[67:57] didn't read the whole thing because some
[67:58] of it's personal. I didn't read the
[67:59] whole thing because it's quite long. The
[68:02] main thing you asked is it wrong to
[68:04] stand up for yourself? And my answer is
[68:05] no.
[68:07] I do not think that you are required as
[68:09] a Christian to continue to receive
[68:13] mistreatment without at least stating
[68:17] the the the issue to the person who is
[68:19] mistreating you. Okay? And so if the
[68:23] person who is mistreating you, and I
[68:24] know who it is because I read the email,
[68:26] but I'm being a little bit vague. If the
[68:29] person who is mistreating you lives with
[68:30] you, and the person who mistreating you
[68:32] is a is is a is a family member, not a
[68:34] spouse, but another family member, and
[68:36] that person is mistreating you in a way
[68:39] that is certainly sinful and certainly
[68:41] wrong. I do not think that it's wrong
[68:43] for you to tell them that they are
[68:47] hurting you and to tell them that their
[68:49] actions are their actions are hurting
[68:52] your relationship. Now, based on what
[68:56] you wrote, it may not go very far. It
[68:58] may not do very much. It may not solve
[69:00] the problem. Jennifer, did you want to
[69:02] say anything about this? I know we
[69:04] talked in about this in the car. don't
[69:06] have to, but this was something that we
[69:08] discussed a little bit and I know
[69:11] >> I think also keeping just continually um
[69:16] you're dealing with an older person. I I
[69:19] can't I I was just thinking about my own
[69:21] experience with my dad is 83 and um he
[69:25] can say he's grieving and sometimes he
[69:29] can gives really short answers or he's
[69:31] very snippy or he you you know um and I
[69:35] just constantly try to try to just
[69:37] respond back in love and just let love
[69:40] cover a multitude of sins with him is
[69:42] the way but I I don't think to be abused
[69:45] I guess I I don't know does that make
[69:48] sense? Yeah. And I think what you just
[69:50] what you just said is something I did
[69:51] forget to mention. So I'm glad you you
[69:53] brought it up. And that is that the
[69:55] reality is
[69:58] we are called as Christians to hold
[70:00] short accounts to to not keep a record
[70:02] of wrongs. That's what love is according
[70:05] to 1 Corinthians 13. Right? Love is
[70:07] patient. Love is kind. It doesn't envy
[70:09] and doesn't boast. It doesn't keep a
[70:10] record of wrongs. Right? So when it
[70:12] comes to loving another person, love
[70:15] covers a multitude of sins. Right?
[70:16] Sometimes we do just move on, right? We
[70:19] just let it go. We we we do say, "I'm
[70:21] not going to hold this thing against
[70:23] you." But if it's got to the point where
[70:25] it's made you miserable, and that was
[70:27] the thing, I think with the email, it's
[70:28] made you miserable. You live in the
[70:29] house with the person, the person is
[70:31] mistreating you, and you're miserable, I
[70:33] think a conversation needs to be had.
[70:35] And you did say he's not like this
[70:37] always. So my counsel to you would be
[70:39] talk to him when he's not upset.
[70:42] talk to him when he's not upset and say,
[70:44] "Listen, um, I know there are times when
[70:48] you get upset and you make you make me
[70:51] feel really bad. You hurt me with your
[70:53] words and I love you and I don't want to
[70:56] feel the way that I feel, but sometimes
[70:58] I feel really upset with you. Sometimes
[71:01] I get really angry with you and I need
[71:03] you to help me by working this out and
[71:07] and let's try to work on this together
[71:09] and and let's have let's have a
[71:11] conversation about what's bringing this
[71:14] about. I mean, again, it may not it may
[71:17] not help, but at least you've you've
[71:19] taken your situation and you've tried to
[71:23] apply some some defense for yourself.
[71:27] not not offense to him, but defense for
[71:30] yourself to say, "Look, you're hurting
[71:32] me. You are you're hurting our
[71:33] relationship. You're hurting how I see
[71:36] you. I want to love you, and I want to
[71:38] treat you well, but you you don't treat
[71:40] me well often." And um and
[71:46] >> maybe that'll be the point where the
[71:47] person sees that.
[71:48] >> Maybe a light bulb will come on, you
[71:50] know, and and we pray that it would. Uh
[71:53] this is not an easy question. And we
[71:56] don't get easy questions,
[71:58] but this is one of the more hard
[72:00] questions because this is such a
[72:01] personal issue. We both have elderly
[72:03] parents. We both have, you know, we both
[72:05] have parents who, you know, struggle
[72:07] with with the with the difficulty of
[72:10] age. And so that's part of it, but you
[72:14] have to be honest.
[72:15] >> I know. On a side note, not really
[72:17] related to the question, but one time uh
[72:19] we were at the hospital with mom as she
[72:21] was passing away and my dad started
[72:23] yelling at my sister and she said,
[72:26] "Nope. Um, you know, I'm not 12 anymore.
[72:29] I'm not going to you're not going to
[72:31] talk to me that way. I'm an adult. You
[72:33] will not talk to me that way." He backed
[72:35] right down. Apolog
[72:41] saying those things.
[72:43] >> Yeah.
[72:43] >> I don't know. No, that I'm glad you told
[72:45] that story because that's really good.
[72:48] Sometimes sometimes it does require that
[72:50] you stand up for yourself. It's not
[72:51] sinful to tell a person that you don't
[72:54] want to be treated a certain way. That
[72:56] that's maybe that's the answer to the
[72:57] whole question. It's not sinful to be
[72:59] honest and say you the way you treat me
[73:02] makes me upset and it hurts me and if
[73:05] you love me, I don't want you to treat
[73:06] me this way because this isn't the way
[73:08] you should treat somebody that you love.
[73:12] Yeah.
[73:15] Uh, somebody asked if we have grandkids
[73:18] yet.
[73:19] The answer is no, but we are praying for
[73:22] them. We have a married daughter and
[73:24] Lord willing, uh, we'll get that call
[73:27] sooner rather than later. All right,
[73:30] let's move on to the next question,
[73:31] Jennifer.
[73:32] >> Okay. Hey, Pastor Keith. Blessed to be a
[73:35] witness to your ministry. Comedy is a
[73:37] market the enemy has cornered, so I'm
[73:40] glad we have you on our side. That being
[73:42] said, my question is this. If you attend
[73:44] a church but no longer can affirm the
[73:46] statement of faith, should you leave? I
[73:48] am a Baptist that attends a Baptist
[73:50] church, but my convictions and studies
[73:52] have led me to affirm a reformed
[73:54] Presbyterian view on baptism. Thank you,
[73:56] sir.
[73:57] >> Well, I just want to say I'm
[73:58] disappointed as a Baptist that you have
[74:00] abandoned ship uh
[74:04] running on after the popular
[74:06] Presbyterians right now. I wonder if it
[74:08] has anything to do with that guy online
[74:09] who keeps saying superior theology. I
[74:11] don't know. Could be. Uh my answer to
[74:14] you is uh you should be in a place where
[74:17] you're able to affirm everything that's
[74:18] taught and um yet at the same time if
[74:23] this is a newly a new conviction that
[74:27] has arisen in your heart and you're in a
[74:29] church that loves you and cares for you
[74:31] and ministers well to you and this isn't
[74:34] going to affect your ability to carry
[74:37] out a conviction. Uh it doesn't mean
[74:39] that you have to move automatically.
[74:41] Like for instance, if you had if you
[74:43] were a father of three and you were and
[74:45] they were all small children or infants
[74:46] and you wanted to baptize them and your
[74:48] church wouldn't let you baptize them
[74:49] because you're a Baptist or you're in a
[74:51] Baptist church, but you've got this
[74:52] conviction of a Presbyterian, then I
[74:54] would say, yeah, it might be time to
[74:55] move on. But if that's not where you
[74:56] are, then it then it might not be as
[74:59] urgent. Eventually though, you should
[75:00] probably find a church where you can
[75:02] live out your convictions. And that's
[75:04] why I believe domin denominations are
[75:06] good. I wrote an article about it just a
[75:07] few weeks ago, why I love denominations.
[75:09] you can see it at my Substack. Um, I
[75:12] think it's good that you can live out
[75:13] your own convictions in that area, even
[75:16] though I believe that you're wrong. So,
[75:18] my encouragement to you would be to say
[75:21] it's not urgent that you move on, but at
[75:24] the same time, I think eventually you
[75:26] probably should just I wouldn't I
[75:28] wouldn't make it I wouldn't make it a
[75:30] huge like I'm leaving because you don't
[75:33] believe everything I believe. I I would
[75:34] just say in your heart perhaps recognize
[75:38] that if this is where if there if this
[75:40] is where your convictions lie then at a
[75:42] certain point you probably want to be
[75:43] want to be in a place where you're able
[75:45] to express those convictions in
[75:47] agreement with other other believers.
[75:49] >> Can I mention this comment too?
[75:51] >> Yes.
[75:51] >> C Chap says talk to your pastor first.
[75:54] >> Oh great. Thank you. Very and and I
[75:56] almost always say that you don't leave a
[75:58] church without talking to your pastor.
[75:59] So thank you C Chaps for reminding me
[76:02] that. That is very good. Also, uh I saw
[76:04] Protesty was out there. Looks like they
[76:05] did a super chat. Always want to uh Let
[76:08] me say this.
[76:09] >> Best show on YouTube. Hey, the entire
[76:11] world.
[76:11] >> A thank you uh guys over at Protesty.
[76:14] Let me say this. I have so many of your
[76:17] videos logged because I've been working
[76:19] on the kitchen, remodeling our kitchen
[76:22] for the last two weeks, the last week
[76:24] and a half, and I really wanted to do a
[76:27] a church soup before the end of the
[76:28] year, but it's just not going to happen.
[76:30] and I just don't have time between now
[76:31] and January 1st
[76:34] >> uh to do a to do a church soup. I may
[76:35] have a denomination video come out this
[76:37] week, but I'll probably have to wait
[76:38] till next week to do a church soup. But
[76:39] it's going to be very protestcentric
[76:42] because I've got so many funny protest
[76:45] videos that got put out over the last
[76:46] couple weeks. So, thank you guys again
[76:48] for letting me letting me continue to
[76:50] use your your library videos. They are
[76:53] awesome.
[76:54] All right. Uh
[76:58] let's let's move on. We're going to go
[77:00] through. We got some long questions. Um,
[77:03] but some of these I think I can give
[77:05] more succinct answers we make our way
[77:07] through.
[77:07] >> Did you want to take a break or you want
[77:08] to do another?
[77:09] >> Uh, let's do a couple more. We'll take a
[77:10] break at the 30 minute one 1 hour and 30
[77:12] minute mark.
[77:13] >> Okay.
[77:16] I feel like this should have been public
[77:18] knowledge in the church. I shouldn't be
[77:20] finding this out this late into my life
[77:22] that the Greek for in means guest space
[77:25] and not public in. If it is indeed true
[77:28] that Mary and Joseph were in their
[77:30] relatives home in Bethlehem, not to
[77:32] mention the stable portion was part of
[77:34] the house and there just wasn't enough
[77:36] spa room for her to have her baby in the
[77:39] guest room because there were so many
[77:41] other relatives that have had that have
[77:44] to have space. Okay, I'm mixing up here.
[77:46] I'm sorry.
[77:48] >> This this email this email starts like
[77:50] it doesn't it doesn't have an
[77:52] introduction. It just says, "I feel like
[77:53] there should be a public knowledge in
[77:55] the church." And then it goes into this
[77:56] this this this argument about things
[77:59] about the Christmas narrative, the the
[78:01] nativity story that that um that this
[78:05] person recently found out. That's the
[78:06] So, it's a little bit hard understanding
[78:08] the context of what you are reading.
[78:10] Ultimately, the question is why are the
[78:12] stories uh why are the Christmas
[78:14] narrative uh not told accurately? And
[78:17] they talk about the fact that the inn
[78:19] was probably uh it wasn't a public in.
[78:21] It was more like a guest room in a
[78:22] family's home. Uh this the the stable
[78:25] was uh or the the the place where the
[78:28] the animals were were actually was part
[78:29] of the home. And uh there were just
[78:32] things. This person wrote this email
[78:34] basically saying why is it that we've
[78:36] had this wrong picture of the nativity?
[78:38] And and they're they said they're pretty
[78:40] upset about the one thing I was
[78:41] appreciative of. They said if I sounded
[78:43] upset in this email I'm not directing my
[78:45] upsetness at you.
[78:46] >> Yeah. Well, thank you for not directing
[78:47] your upsetness at me, but let me just
[78:49] say this about what you're saying. Yes,
[78:53] there are there are things about the
[78:56] nativity story which have become
[79:00] traditions like the barn picture that we
[79:04] often see, the nativity uh scene looks
[79:07] like the inside of a barn. Uh the uh uh
[79:12] there there's a there there's a lot in
[79:14] the story. the end there. Obviously,
[79:16] there wasn't a Motel 6 in Bethlehem,
[79:18] right? So, when it says the end, what is
[79:20] the end? Well, it's like you said, it
[79:22] was it was most likely the room in a in
[79:25] a home, a family home where people could
[79:26] stay, a guest space. Um, and and so I
[79:31] was trying to understand as I read your
[79:34] email, I was trying to understand why
[79:36] you were
[79:38] frustrated because you did say, you
[79:40] know, I'm I'm upset and and and I feel
[79:42] like this should be public knowledge.
[79:45] And
[79:47] I think that this is one of those times
[79:49] where
[79:51] I understand that you're you're
[79:53] frustrated because you feel like maybe
[79:55] things that you've been taught in the
[79:56] past didn't line up with exactly what
[79:58] was said in the text, but there are
[80:01] times where certain things are
[80:06] uh knowledge increases and and and and
[80:09] you said you watched a video about uh
[80:12] the someone teaching about this and it
[80:14] taught you some things that you didn't
[80:15] know before. Well, there there are
[80:17] people who have taught and read and and
[80:20] and and and sought to understand these
[80:22] texts that didn't know maybe some of
[80:24] what was in the video that you found or
[80:25] or some of the information that you
[80:27] found. And so, I don't the point I'm
[80:30] making is I don't think that the the the
[80:33] things that you learned in the past were
[80:34] intentionally misleading. I think a lot
[80:36] of people just read what's in the text
[80:38] and and and and sometimes they include
[80:41] anacronisms and things like at the end,
[80:43] right? We think about is there a
[80:44] Bethlehem in, right? We we we think
[80:46] about the inkeeper. Well, the Bible
[80:48] never mentions an inkeeper, right? But
[80:50] every play that I've ever seen that
[80:52] deals with the Christmas story has an
[80:55] inkeeper, right? Even though there
[80:56] wasn't an inkeeper. So, I I I I
[81:01] would step back and say I don't think
[81:03] that anyone who has taught on these
[81:07] texts or tried to explain these texts
[81:09] has been intentionally
[81:11] misleading. Maybe they just didn't
[81:13] understand what you now have learned
[81:16] about the the social atmosphere and the
[81:20] way that homes were built and things
[81:22] like that from the past. And some of
[81:23] this information does become more
[81:26] available to us through archaeological
[81:28] studies and through historical studies
[81:30] and studies of other documents, extra
[81:32] biblical sources and stuff like that.
[81:33] So, I wouldn't get upset that
[81:37] perhaps the picture you had in your mind
[81:40] is now different because you you've got
[81:42] new information. Um, I would just simply
[81:46] say that's what happens as as we learn.
[81:49] We we learn and grow. And I just can't I
[81:53] can't imagine someone knowing this and
[81:58] intentionally teaching it wrong.
[82:00] Sometimes traditions develop from a
[82:04] traditional understanding of the text
[82:06] that is not actually
[82:09] consistent with history, but at the same
[82:11] time doesn't mean that it was
[82:13] intentionally trying to change
[82:14] something. So I guess my answer and and
[82:17] I hope it makes sense. I hope people
[82:19] listening I haven't just lost everybody.
[82:21] But basically, my encouragement to you
[82:24] is to recognize that you're going to be
[82:27] a lifelong learner when it comes to
[82:29] scripture. And you're going to be
[82:31] learning things that maybe you thought
[82:34] were a certain way at one point. And now
[82:36] you learn a little bit better. And maybe
[82:40] you're going to learn m more than
[82:41] sometimes even what your teachers knew
[82:43] at a certain point. And that's good. So
[82:47] don't get upset when you learn something
[82:49] new. And don't feel like you've been
[82:51] misled if it's something different than
[82:52] what you were taught in the past. Just
[82:54] recognize that sometimes people have
[82:57] taught things that either they taught in
[82:58] ignorance, they didn't know, or they
[83:00] were taking the text in a way that were
[83:02] they were applying modern understandings
[83:05] to the text that they really were not
[83:07] right about, but they didn't know. They
[83:08] weren't doing it intentionally. And
[83:10] that's the part that I think is why I
[83:13] would avoid being upset about it. I
[83:15] don't think people are intentionally
[83:16] misleading when it comes to these
[83:18] things. And um I hope that makes sense.
[83:22] Am I
[83:22] >> making sense?
[83:23] >> It's just about being intentional,
[83:25] right? If somebody was intentionally
[83:27] misleading, they knew the facts, but
[83:29] then they were leading incorrectly, I
[83:32] think that would be a serious error.
[83:34] Also, when you when you when you're
[83:37] talking about the things that you've
[83:38] learned from this video that you
[83:39] watched, are you certain that everything
[83:41] in that video was correct? Have you
[83:43] researched that? Because I've seen guys
[83:46] who will come up with arguments from
[83:49] modern archaeology studies and they say,
[83:51] "Well, this must be what this was and
[83:53] this must be what that was." But then
[83:54] later that gets debunked. So, have you
[83:56] have you looked into what that video
[83:58] taught you to make sure that that is
[84:00] actually accurate? So, those are some
[84:02] things that I think are important uh to
[84:05] to not allow yourself to get so upset,
[84:08] but instead
[84:10] um just be thankful that the Lord is
[84:12] teaching you new things. And as he does
[84:15] then grow in his word and grow in his
[84:17] knowledge of him. And none of this
[84:18] Jennifer mentioned this because we
[84:19] talked about this in the car earlier
[84:20] because we we read through the questions
[84:22] early and we were reading through this
[84:24] question. Jennifer made a good point.
[84:26] None of this changes the heart of the
[84:27] gospel. And these are really incidental
[84:30] details about the coming of the Lord
[84:32] Jesus Christ. None of this even really
[84:33] changes the narrative. Caught the pen.
[84:35] That was pretty awesome. I dropped it
[84:36] and caught it in the same hand.
[84:38] Um so don't allow this to cause you
[84:44] so much distress. That would be my
[84:46] encouragement to you. All right, let's
[84:50] uh move to the next question.
[84:52] >> Okay.
[84:53] >> Is it Wes Huff that did a video on it?
[84:55] Is that the Castle Keeper said that? Is
[84:58] that what the the the video that that
[85:01] Cuz let me see. She said
[85:04] >> I think someone else said Dr. White did
[85:06] too, but I don't think she said that.
[85:10] Um, oh, Kevin Aosta is a movie she
[85:13] mentioned. She said, "I found this out
[85:15] this year when I was 32 years old and by
[85:17] a Kevin Aosta movie I watched. I think
[85:20] that it's wrong. I've been in church all
[85:21] my life and I've never heard about this
[85:23] before." Again, though, some of this
[85:24] stuff is new information. Some of this
[85:26] stuff is is is stuff that a lot of
[85:28] pastors, teachers, a lot of people may
[85:30] not have known um as far as how the
[85:33] homes were built and things like that.
[85:35] So, I wouldn't I I I wouldn't I wouldn't
[85:38] take it as a I wouldn't take it as a
[85:42] thing to get offended by.
[85:44] >> Well, regardless, Mary wasn't giving
[85:46] birth in the bedroom in that part of the
[85:48] house. She was
[85:49] >> Jesus was laid miser.
[85:51] >> We have the text and we can go with what
[85:54] the text says,
[85:55] >> right? And whether the word in means a a
[85:59] room, a guest room, and a home. I did I
[86:01] taught on the nativity this year and uh
[86:03] I didn't even deal with a lot with this
[86:05] issue. What I did say was I believe
[86:07] Joseph's hometown was Bethlehem. I don't
[86:10] think that it was just the town of his
[86:11] ancestors. I think it was where Joseph
[86:13] was actually from. Um and I think he
[86:17] lived in in in Bethlehem and I think
[86:19] Mary lived in Nazareth and I think he he
[86:21] he he was he he was in Nazareth because
[86:24] he was betrod to her. But I think his
[86:27] home was in Bethlehem. That's I think
[86:28] that's pro his family home would have
[86:30] been in Bethlehem because that's where
[86:31] they would have lived during that
[86:33] several month period between the time of
[86:35] Jesus's birth and the time of their
[86:37] flight to Egypt which could have been up
[86:39] to over
[86:41] >> bless you
[86:41] >> over
[86:43] sorry over several months pardon me. Uh
[86:48] so there's a whole lot about the
[86:49] nativity story. If you want to hear my
[86:51] teaching on it, go to sermon audio. Uh
[86:53] or actually go to our um it's not on
[86:56] sermon audio, it's on our our sovereign
[86:57] grace YouTube channel. You'll see uh my
[87:00] teaching through the nativity, which is
[87:01] I compared Mark's go or Matthew's gospel
[87:04] and Luke's gospel on the history of the
[87:05] nativity.
[87:07] All right, let's uh let's move on.
[87:09] >> Okay.
[87:11] I'm a 21-year-old male who recently left
[87:14] my family's independent Pentecostal
[87:16] Holiness Church due to their beliefs on
[87:18] salvation. The pastor there teaches that
[87:20] a person is not saved unless they have
[87:22] spoken in tongues, which I have not.
[87:25] Because of this teaching, I was never
[87:27] baptized. Even though I first came to
[87:29] faith over 5 years ago, leaving has been
[87:32] quite challenging as my family is deeply
[87:35] rooted in these beliefs. My uncle is
[87:37] even the co-pastor of the church. I
[87:39] should also clarify that my disagreement
[87:42] is not limited to that church, but
[87:44] extends to the broader Pentecostal view
[87:46] of salvation. I have watched your comedy
[87:48] videos for quite some time and have
[87:50] recently started listening to your
[87:51] theology content as well. The main
[87:54] reason I'm reaching out is that you
[87:56] consistently ground your positions in
[87:58] careful exesus of the text. I'm
[88:01] wondering if there are theologians,
[88:02] pastors or teachers you would recommend
[88:04] for understanding systematic theology,
[88:07] especially sotiology and esquetology who
[88:10] also faithfully exedute scripture but
[88:12] arrive at different conclusions than you
[88:14] do.
[88:17] Okay.
[88:18] >> Okay. Um, that was a lot to to to uh uh
[88:23] to to go through. Thank you for for
[88:24] reaching out. Number one, let me just
[88:26] say this about the Pentecostal Holiness
[88:28] Church that if anyone says that you're
[88:30] not saved because you haven't spoken in
[88:32] tongues. That is absolutely false.
[88:36] There's no scriptural warrant for that
[88:38] claim. There's no scriptural evidence
[88:41] that all believers must speak in
[88:43] tongues. In fact, the Apostle Paul says
[88:45] the opposite. He says, "Do all speak
[88:46] with tongues?" And the answer is no. All
[88:49] do not speak with tongues. Just like all
[88:51] do not prophesy and all do not have the
[88:54] gifts uh no one has all the gifts and no
[88:57] one no one gift is given to all people
[89:00] including the gift of tongues. Now I
[89:02] believe that uh when we when we start
[89:06] going down that road, there's a lot of
[89:08] other things in the Pentecostal
[89:09] charismatic teaching that we could talk
[89:10] about, but that's one. Someone says you
[89:12] have to speak in tongues to be a
[89:13] believer, I just say that there's no
[89:16] evidence of that. No evidence of that in
[89:18] scripture and and it's that there's just
[89:21] a no reason to believe that at all. Now,
[89:24] you asked the question though, uh are
[89:27] there theologians, pastors or teachers
[89:29] who you would recommend for
[89:30] understanding systematic theology who
[89:33] are faithfully executing scripture but
[89:35] arrive at different conclusions than you
[89:37] do? Well, basically you're asking me,
[89:40] are there pastors that I disagree with
[89:42] that I still listen to? And the answer
[89:44] is yes. David Guzzk would be a good
[89:47] example of this. David Guzzk wrote the
[89:50] Enduring Word commentary. He also has
[89:52] the Enduring Word study Bible, which I
[89:54] have one right over there. Uh David
[89:57] Guzik is from the Calvary Chapel
[89:59] Movement, but David Guzik is he's not a
[90:01] Calvinist. He's a dispensationalist. So,
[90:03] I believe he's wrong on a few things.
[90:06] But David and I are both brothers in the
[90:08] Lord. We love each other and we love the
[90:09] Lord together. And uh so he would be one
[90:12] that I would say, "Yeah, I would
[90:13] recommend his commentary to you. I would
[90:15] recommend his study Bible to you." Uh I
[90:18] I don't agree with Presbyterians on
[90:20] everything, but I would definitely
[90:21] recommend their resources to you. James
[90:23] Montgomery Boyce was a tremendous
[90:25] teacher, theologian, and pastor, and I
[90:28] use his commentary on the Gospel of John
[90:30] as I'm preparing my sermons on that
[90:32] gospel. So there's another one who I
[90:34] would not agree with 100%. FF Bruce was
[90:37] more of a continuationist and someone
[90:40] who I would disagree with on certain
[90:42] things, but his commentary on the go on
[90:44] the book of Acts as well as several
[90:46] other uh books that he has written have
[90:48] been tremendously beneficial to me. So
[90:50] there are just three right off the top
[90:52] of my head that are from different uh
[90:54] faith traditions that I would appreciate
[90:57] and would point you to. Um, as far as a
[91:00] systematic theology,
[91:02] most of the ones that I would recommend
[91:03] would probably come more from the
[91:05] reformed line. Uh, uh,
[91:11] my favorite systematic theology is James
[91:14] Pedigrew Boyce, which was, uh, he was
[91:17] first president of the Southern Baptist
[91:18] Theological Seminary. And I I have that
[91:21] one right over there. And to me,
[91:23] honestly, it's just a tremendous work,
[91:25] and it's over 200 years old. And so he's
[91:28] an example of of one that I would
[91:30] recommend, a good resource. He's not
[91:32] from a different tradition, though. You
[91:33] asked me about people from different
[91:35] different faith traditions. He's just
[91:37] one that I recommend a lot. Uh and that
[91:40] that's my answer. I mean, I I could
[91:44] spend all night just walking through
[91:46] different guys, but if you know, you
[91:48] asked, "Are there theologians, pastors,
[91:50] and teachers you'd recommend for
[91:51] understanding systematic theology?" Yes,
[91:52] there are. I gave you a few. Um, I
[91:56] honestly am not I I I I would have a
[92:00] hard time pointing to any charismatic
[92:02] teachers. Like I said, I I said that,
[92:03] you know, I mentioned FF Bruce,
[92:05] continuationist, but um, someone full
[92:08] full-on charismatic, I would have a hard
[92:09] time pointing you to because a lot of
[92:10] those guys I I don't really don't really
[92:14] read a whole lot of their material. So,
[92:17] uh, that that would be a hard one for me
[92:19] to come off come up with off top of my
[92:22] head. Any
[92:24] thoughts? Any questions? Anybody? Uh,
[92:26] somebody mentioned Wayne Grudam. That
[92:28] that's a good question. Wayne Grudum is
[92:30] uh uh uh we have used his material in
[92:33] our sovereign grace academy. So we do
[92:35] endorse his material and Wayne Grudum is
[92:37] a continuationist and he has a
[92:38] systematic theology and his his his
[92:40] section on sotariology would be
[92:42] Calvinistic. So it would agree with me
[92:43] for the most part. So um I would say we
[92:47] probably have great great agreement on
[92:48] on most everything. So Wayne Gruden
[92:51] would be a good example of someone that
[92:53] I would point you to.
[92:55] All right, moving on to the next
[92:58] question. We got we we we we're going to
[93:00] take this and then we're going to take a
[93:01] break.
[93:01] >> Okay.
[93:03] >> I haven't been listening long, but I
[93:05] love your content and especially your
[93:08] how cordial you are with about other
[93:10] denominations. I have run into an issue
[93:13] recently. An acquaintance of mine that I
[93:15] used to go to church with has over the
[93:17] last year or so moved into the
[93:19] universalist camp. He says it is the
[93:21] most historic position uh the most
[93:24] dominant in the very early church and
[93:26] was overtaken only in the fourth or
[93:28] fifth century by ect. We've discussed
[93:31] online, which is of course the best
[93:33] place for reasonable dialogue on
[93:35] controversial subjects, but I can't
[93:37] really get him to answer how he squares
[93:40] eternal punishment in Matthew 25:46.
[93:43] He just says there's something about
[93:45] first century Jews not having a concept
[93:48] for eternity, fire is for purification,
[93:51] etc. How do I answer him biblically?
[93:54] >> Okay. Uh right away uh when I first read
[93:57] your question, I kind of got a little
[93:59] confused because you said that you have
[94:01] a friend who is going into the
[94:03] universalist camp and and then you said
[94:06] that he was arguing against etern
[94:08] eternal conscious torment, ect, which
[94:11] made me think maybe what you meant was
[94:13] that he was going into the
[94:14] annihilationist camp, which would also
[94:18] uh be opposed to ect. But then I got to
[94:20] thinking about it. No, you you probably
[94:22] did mean universalist because a
[94:23] universalist would obviously reject
[94:26] eternal conscious torment because they
[94:27] don't believe anyone is going to be
[94:28] punished for anything because ultimately
[94:31] the universalist would say all would
[94:32] ultimately be redeemed. Even though some
[94:35] people would say the redeemed comes
[94:37] after a time of punishment or
[94:38] purification, right? But ultimately in
[94:41] the universalist view, everybody
[94:43] eventually gets saved. So, uh how do you
[94:47] how do you respond? Well, I'm going to
[94:49] respond from the position of the
[94:52] historical argument. His argument, he
[94:54] says, according to you, he says that um
[94:58] it's the most historical position. I
[95:01] don't think that that I don't think that
[95:03] that's the case. I think that it is very
[95:06] easy to cherrypick
[95:10] uh quotes from church fathers to try to
[95:13] make arguments for certain positions.
[95:16] And I know this for a fact because I
[95:18] watched Dale Tuggy do this. Yes, that's
[95:21] his real name, Dale Tuggy.
[95:24] Uh Dale Tuggy debated James White this
[95:26] year and I was there in the audience.
[95:29] They debated the subject of the Trinity.
[95:32] Dale Tuggy is a Unitarian and he argued
[95:35] that all of the early church fathers
[95:38] prior to the time of Nya that all the
[95:43] early church fathers believed in
[95:46] different views of the divinity of
[95:49] Christ and there wasn't a there wasn't a
[95:52] real unilateral view and ultimately he
[95:54] argued that the unitarian view that God
[95:57] is divine and Jesus Christ is uh uh
[96:02] uh the the word of God made flesh, but
[96:05] that that he did not pre-exist the his
[96:07] his birth that that that idea is what
[96:11] was was what was believed by the early
[96:13] fathers. And he was pulling out this
[96:14] quote and this and this other quote and
[96:16] and it just proved to me and and I made
[96:18] this argument on a previous show. It
[96:20] proved to me that if you just take
[96:23] cherrypicked
[96:25] quotes from the early fathers, you can
[96:27] make them say just about anything you
[96:29] want. And um and so when he says, "Well,
[96:34] the most the the the the the
[96:38] view of the uh how do you say it? I'm
[96:41] trying to find it here. The the the most
[96:43] historic position and the dominant
[96:45] position is universalism." I don't think
[96:48] that that's accurate. I I I I would I
[96:51] would press hard against that. I would
[96:52] say prove it. If you if if you want to
[96:55] say that the that the position of the
[96:58] early church was that everyone goes to
[97:00] heaven, that everyone ultimately is
[97:03] redeemed by Christ, and that no one
[97:06] suffers eternal punishment. One, I would
[97:08] say you I don't think you can square
[97:10] that with Daniel 12. I don't think you
[97:12] can square that with uh the Gospels. I
[97:15] don't think you can square that with the
[97:16] writings of Paul. certainly don't think
[97:18] you can square that with Revelation
[97:20] which talks about the the the wicked
[97:22] being cast into the lake of fire where
[97:25] they will suffer right eternally. I
[97:28] don't I don't think that you can square
[97:30] universalism with any of that. And the
[97:34] early fathers I don't think would have
[97:35] agreed with that either. And so I would
[97:38] I would tell him it's the onus is on you
[97:40] to prove that and not just with one or
[97:42] two quotes. I I'm going to need to see
[97:45] some pretty substantial evidence and I
[97:48] haven't seen it. I haven't seen it. So,
[97:51] that that's that's that's that would be
[97:52] my answer.
[97:54] All right. Uh
[97:57] Lampert said, "How do I ask a question?
[97:59] I do have uh do I have to do a super
[98:01] chat?" No, you don't have to do a super
[98:03] chat, but here's a thing that you do
[98:04] need to know. Uh we we we receive

[98:23] the comments, we try to get to those,
[98:25] but we rarely have time and we don't
[98:27] really have time to finish all the

[99:54] Hey guys, uh just want to say thank you
[99:56] for continuing to be with us. Jennifer
[99:57] mentioned to me during the break that we
[99:59] had some super chats that we had not uh
[100:01] had not talked about. One was from
[100:04] potato sandwich. Just want to say thank
[100:05] you that he says he prays that the Lord
[100:07] will continue to feed us from his word
[100:08] in the coming year. God bless. Thank you
[100:10] so much for that. Potato sandwich.
[100:12] Michael Foster came in and said he
[100:14] wanted me to sing Journey.
[100:16] I'm trying to think of a Journey song.
[100:18] >> Just a Small Town.
[100:19] >> Is that Is that it? Yeah. Okay. Uh well,
[100:22] Michael's probably gone by now. I know
[100:24] he probably didn't hang out for the
[100:25] whole two hours, but if he does hear
[100:27] this, just a small girl
[100:32] living in a lonely world.
[100:36] She took the midnight train going
[100:39] anywhere.
[100:42] >> I love to hear you say, "Okay, you're
[100:43] supposed to." Okay. All right. And then,
[100:46] of course, Aztec, thank you for that
[100:48] wonderful donation, brother. We
[100:50] appreciate it. Daily reforming says, "Is
[100:52] it okay to be a member of a less than
[100:53] ideal church that you are gathering and
[100:55] have the fellowship, etc., and then to
[100:58] worship with SGFC Jacks online?" Well,
[101:01] um I mean,
[101:04] >> yeah. I mean, I would say this, we we we
[101:07] love to know that you're out there
[101:08] watching and being with us online, but
[101:10] certainly try to be as faithful as you
[101:12] can to your local church. That that
[101:14] would be my my admonition. And and if
[101:16] it's less than ideal, there's no perfect
[101:18] church. and be be as faithful as you can
[101:20] to the most faithful church you can.
[101:22] That would be that would be my
[101:23] admonition. But certainly continue to
[101:25] watch and we hope that it continues to
[101:26] be a blessing to you. Uh Michael Coggin
[101:29] says, "Happy New Year's. Have you
[101:31] experienced a significant drop in
[101:32] attendance in your church? I'm a pastor
[101:34] and a group of the Filipinos recently
[101:36] stopped attending our church to start a
[101:38] church. I'm happy for them, but it was
[101:39] discouraging."
[101:41] Um I Yes. You you asked, "Have we ever
[101:43] experienced a significant drop in
[101:45] attendance?" That's that's a good
[101:46] question, Michael. And my answer is we
[101:49] we have gone we have ups and downs. I I
[101:52] I preached on this last Sunday. In fact,
[101:53] you might do well to go and listen to my
[101:56] sermon from last week. Michael, uh if
[101:58] you go to SGFC Jack's, go to the live
[102:01] and the last live video is our last
[102:03] service. I end up preach an hour and 10
[102:05] minutes. I rarely do that, but I
[102:06] preached a long time on the history of
[102:08] our church and where we've gone this
[102:09] year and where we're going. And one of
[102:11] the things I prayed and asked the people
[102:13] to consider was to consider consistency
[102:15] because we do have an issue with
[102:16] sometimes we'll have really low
[102:18] attendance, sometimes we have really
[102:19] high attendance. And that lack of
[102:21] consistency, I think really is hurtful
[102:23] and it causes us causes us to struggle.
[102:26] So um uh brother, I think that message
[102:29] might be an encouragement to you. So go
[102:30] go and check that out. And if you if you
[102:32] can't find it, send me an email and I'll
[102:34] send you a link. Um, but yeah, we we
[102:37] deal with all kinds of different issues
[102:38] and there is just no
[102:41] there is just no perfect church that
[102:45] you're not going to find one. Uh,
[102:47] already talked about Protestia. Thank
[102:49] you again for that. That and was that
[102:51] all of them?
[102:52] >> I think that was all of them. Great.
[102:53] Well, want to make sure we we say thanks
[102:55] to everybody who's doing the super chats
[102:57] and certainly we have a lot of people
[102:58] out there that are commenting. Where
[103:00] where did our commenting? Where' they
[103:01] go? There they are. Their live chat
[103:03] right there. All right. Um, we only have
[103:05] a few questions left. We're gonna try to
[103:07] make it through the end uh of tonight.
[103:11] What? What's up, Jennifer? You keep
[103:12] looking.
[103:13] >> No, I just like this quote. Tea Chap
[103:15] says, Adrienne Rogers once said, "If you
[103:17] find a perfect church, don't join it
[103:19] because it won't be perfect."
[103:20] >> That's right. You will ruin it. Do you
[103:22] have anything to drink?
[103:23] >> Yeah, lemonade.
[103:24] >> May I?
[103:25] >> Yeah.
[103:25] >> Thank you. All right. So, uh, um,
[103:30] >> this this next question is such a good
[103:32] question regarding what so many people,
[103:35] I'm sure, are going through. So,
[103:36] Jennifer, I'd like for you to read it.
[103:39] Um, and and and
[103:42] the only thing I would say
[103:43] >> would be able to
[103:44] >> maybe uh
[103:46] there's one thing I would say right
[103:48] here, just leave that out.
[103:52] >> Okay.
[103:53] >> Okay. All right. Go ahead. M
[103:55] >> looking for some wisdom on navigating
[103:57] sin in my 13-year-old son's life. He has
[104:00] been open that he is struggling with
[104:01] porn. A bit of background. We have
[104:04] always been very cautious about giving
[104:06] him access to media on TV or internet
[104:09] access. He does not have a laptop
[104:13] uh he uses or a smartphone. But back in
[104:16] February, he had to spend some time at
[104:18] my parents while I was in the hospital.
[104:20] They let him spend a lot of time on a
[104:22] tablet online for those two days. It was
[104:25] here where he encountered it porn and I
[104:28] feel like it's had a hold of him ever
[104:30] since. We finally got him a flip phone
[104:33] with no data on it. Um it is Wi-Fi
[104:36] enabled. We didn't connect to our Wi-Fi,
[104:38] but he has admitted that when he goes
[104:41] out, he connects to hotspots and tries
[104:43] to find inappropriate things. We have
[104:45] now taken this phone from him as well.
[104:47] He professes Christ and I feel on one
[104:50] hand he is battling it but on the other
[104:52] hand he is seeking porn and
[104:54] self-pleasure as well. I have had some
[104:57] discussions with him about staying in
[104:59] God's word in prayer and he also has
[105:01] been reading a book on overcoming
[105:03] temptation. I also have encouraged him
[105:06] not to be be idol. There is more I could
[105:08] share but I'll leave it at that. So my
[105:10] question is do you have any wisdom on
[105:11] this? Do you have any suggestion for
[105:14] resources that could help guide him and
[105:16] myself through this? Thank you.
[105:18] >> Okay. Uh first of all I just want to uh
[105:23] say this is this is such a
[105:27] common issue today that I would say this
[105:30] is the scourge of our generation because
[105:34] the
[105:36] the internet has made access to
[105:40] pornography
[105:41] so easy
[105:44] and so fast
[105:48] and It it it it it
[105:54] the amount of people that need help,
[105:57] counseling, prayer in this area is
[106:02] so high that it it's hard to even it's
[106:06] hard to even relate how high and and and
[106:09] how much it is. Um and uh I I do have to
[106:14] just mention somebody said, "Do you
[106:15] still like Fresca?" Yes, I do. And this
[106:17] has nothing to do with the question. And
[106:19] someone said I shouldn't be drinking
[106:20] from a red solo cup because that
[106:22] apparently is bad. It looks like
[106:24] >> I think they were joking. I think they
[106:26] were joking.
[106:27] >> I like we're in a kitchen remodel.
[106:28] Everything is
[106:29] >> Yeah, everything's red. Right now we're
[106:30] eating off paper plates and red solo
[106:32] cups. So
[106:34] um but this is what Jennifer and I were
[106:36] reading this in the car and um we're
[106:38] driving going to pick up a new table
[106:39] tonight and we were talking about this
[106:41] question and we both said the same
[106:42] thing. You're doing everything right.
[106:45] that and and and I rarely would say
[106:47] that, but based on everything you wrote
[106:49] about what you've done with your son and
[106:52] trying to take away the outside the the
[106:54] outside opportunities for him to seek
[106:57] out pornography, whether it be through a
[106:58] phone or internet or whatever, whether
[107:00] it be um praying with him, pointing him
[107:03] to Christ, and offering up uh
[107:07] opportunities for him to study things
[107:10] like you said you you had a book that
[107:12] you were reading him on overcoming
[107:14] temptation. And I can't really add a lot
[107:16] to what you're already doing other than
[107:18] to say that I'm going to pray for you
[107:21] right now. I'm going to pray for him
[107:23] because this is such a dangerous
[107:25] scourge. This is such a terrible thing
[107:27] that has made its way into the lives of
[107:29] our of our
[107:31] men and and women, but but men in
[107:34] particular and boys. Um the the the
[107:37] visual medium of pornography is such an
[107:40] allure to men and it is such a dangerous
[107:44] and and evil thing and yet so so uh
[107:49] appealing to the flesh and and and and
[107:51] draws in the mind and the and the and
[107:53] the lust. And so I I want to pray for
[107:56] you, Jen. We're going to pray for him.
[107:57] But before we do, I just want to
[107:59] sayntion I think you are
[108:01] >> based on what you wrote, you are trying
[108:03] your best to do a good job. and I can
[108:05] just pray for you and say, don't give
[108:07] up. Trust the Lord.
[108:10] As far as resources, I there there there
[108:13] are a few out there that are good. I
[108:15] there was a book years ago that was
[108:17] written. I mentioned it on the show
[108:18] before. It's a book called Every Man's
[108:20] Battle. Some people don't like it. Some
[108:21] people don't think it's great, but I
[108:23] will say this. I read it when it first
[108:25] came out, and I thought it did do a good
[108:27] job of one thing. It pointed out the the
[108:29] the reality of how easy it is for men to
[108:36] fall into the trap of lust and how how
[108:38] quickly lust can overtake someone and
[108:41] how and I just think that book did a
[108:43] good job of pointing that out. It had
[108:45] some its recommendations like bouncing
[108:47] the eyes and things like that might be
[108:49] might be a little oversimplified, but I
[108:52] still think what it did in pointing out
[108:54] the issue and and helping see what the
[108:57] issues are, I think it was was good for
[109:00] that. So, if you can get a I found a
[109:02] copy of that in a used bookstore
[109:03] recently and I I grabbed it because I
[109:04] was like, you know what, I'm going to
[109:05] get I'm going to have this for the next
[109:07] person I talk to that deals with this.
[109:09] It might give them something that um
[109:13] that that could be useful. So, uh, so,
[109:15] so that that's that's an old resource.
[109:17] I'm sure there's better ones. I'm sure
[109:19] there's guys who who've written other
[109:20] things. In fact, I I'll give you give me
[109:24] one second. Did Did you want to
[109:27] >> Oh, yeah. Shall Finally Free by Heath
[109:29] Lambert.
[109:30] >> Okay. Finally Free by Heath Lambert. Let
[109:32] me look one other quick thing
[109:34] >> and just Can I talk real quick?
[109:35] >> Yeah. No, please. just I got this this
[109:37] might be a little young for 13 but a
[109:40] couple of years ago I got this book with
[109:42] my for my older well at the time 11
[109:47] 8 you know um it's called good pictures
[109:49] bad pictures and it's a book that you
[109:51] can walk through together and it talks
[109:54] about kind of the addictive nature like
[109:57] your brain is just not
[109:59] able to process what it's seeing and
[110:02] what to do if you accidentally see it on
[110:03] a phone or what Um, it might be a little
[110:07] a little young, but it was helpful for
[110:09] for us.
[110:11] >> There was a book that someone sent me,
[110:13] and I can't find the name of it.
[110:17] Um,
[110:19] I think it was called
[110:22] Was it What was you? What did you just
[110:24] say?
[110:24] >> Good pictures, bad pictures.
[110:25] >> And what was the name of
[110:28] I think there was a name called Finally
[110:30] Free.
[110:31] >> Oh,
[110:32] >> let me look it up real quick. Maybe. I'm
[110:34] sorry. I I don't want to take too much
[110:35] time here, but um
[110:37] >> Yeah, every man's battle. That's that
[110:39] that was the one you were talking about.
[110:41] >> Yeah. No, but there was a
[110:45] I I you guys may not know this, but I
[110:47] have a lot of people that send me books
[110:48] to read and to give uh uh endorsements
[110:53] for and things like that. And
[110:55] >> freedom from that one.
[110:56] >> Freedom from Lust by Jared Moore, I
[110:59] think is the name of it here. Yeah. 33
[111:02] Days to Freedom from Lust by Dr. Jared
[111:05] Moore, but I don't know if it's out yet.
[111:07] It's copyrighted this year and I wrote I
[111:11] think I wrote an endorsement for it. I
[111:12] have to go look back go back and look
[111:14] that up. That one would be one I would
[111:16] look for when it comes out. I think
[111:18] that's still in the in the in the
[111:20] production phase. But again, going back,
[111:23] we're going to pray right now for this
[111:24] young man. Pray for this family. And
[111:26] just know you're not alone. This is a
[111:29] problem that's common to many people.
[111:31] having conversations with your son about
[111:33] it, giving him accountability. Things
[111:35] that you're already doing are the right
[111:36] things and continue to do them.
[111:38] >> Father, we pray for this man. We pray
[111:40] for his son. We pray for this sin of of
[111:42] of lust that it would be be taken away
[111:45] from him. And Lord, that he would be
[111:47] able to be lifted up to uh learn what
[111:50] real manhood and real virtue is. And and
[111:53] it is is avoiding the horish woman,
[111:55] avoiding the the one the woman who is a
[111:58] deep ditch who would lead you down to
[111:59] hell. Lord, what the Proverbs tells
[112:01] these dangerous dangerous things that
[112:03] come and and and provide lust of the
[112:05] eyes and lust of the flesh. And so,
[112:07] Lord, I pray for him. I pray, Lord, that
[112:09] you would sanctify him. That you would
[112:10] keep him from this sin. And that you
[112:11] would give his father and mother wisdom
[112:13] as they seek to minister to their son
[112:15] who they love. And I pray, Lord, that
[112:17] they would continue to love him and be
[112:18] patient with him as he struggles with
[112:20] this. And I do l pray Lord that your
[112:22] Holy Spirit would fill him, would keep
[112:24] him from temptation. And Lord, that you
[112:26] would deliver him from this evil sin
[112:28] that is so easily uh easily gotten
[112:33] today, so easily sought out today. I
[112:35] pray that you would help him and that
[112:36] you would draw him away from that, Lord.
[112:38] That you would give him godly sorrow
[112:40] which leads to repentance. We pray this
[112:42] in Jesus name. Amen.
[112:45] All right,
[112:49] getting close to the end. Getting close
[112:50] to the end.
[112:53] All right, we got another super chat
[112:55] came in from Rumbleard. Thank you so
[112:57] much. We appreciate the donation. It's
[112:59] very much a blessing to our family and
[113:03] we thank you for it. All right, we are
[113:05] at 153.
[113:06] >> Thank you so much for your show, Mr.
[113:08] Fosski. I've had a question on my heart
[113:10] for several months and wanted to seek
[113:12] your insight. I've been wrestling with
[113:14] where I land on Genesis 1. I've studied
[113:16] both positions, young earth creationism
[113:18] and old earth creationism, and I can see
[113:21] see the appeal of each. After watching
[113:23] your debate with Redeem Zoomer, I
[113:25] thought it would be helpful to ask you
[113:27] how you personally came to your
[113:28] conclusion. All of my elders hold to a
[113:31] young earth view, and we have had many
[113:33] good and thoughtful discussions about
[113:34] it. At the same time, I am a public
[113:37] school student and have studied the
[113:39] scientific evidence for an old earth,
[113:41] which I find compelling in many ways. My
[113:43] greatest concern is remaining faithful
[113:45] to scripture. I do not want to
[113:47] compromise biblical authority, yet I
[113:49] also want to think carefully and
[113:50] honestly about the evidence I've
[113:52] encountered. Do you have any advice for
[113:54] someone navigating this?
[113:55] >> Yeah, very, very good question. Uh,
[113:57] before we go into that though, somebody
[113:59] said Rewire Your Heart by David Bowen.
[114:01] I've never read that, but I'm putting it
[114:03] up there as a viewer a viewer
[114:07] recommendation for this uh for the last
[114:09] question. So, Rewire Your Heart by David
[114:12] Bowen. check that out. That might be a a
[114:14] great resource. Um, when it comes to the
[114:16] question of why I am how did I come to
[114:19] my conclusion about young earth
[114:20] creation. Well, uh, two things lead me
[114:24] to the well, three things lead me to the
[114:26] young earth position. Uh the most
[114:29] specific thing that leads me to the
[114:31] young earth position is I I I think that
[114:35] the uh the Bible supports a
[114:41] uh a created universe that was created
[114:46] in its in its maturity. Uh that that's
[114:49] the best way I can describe it. Adam
[114:51] when he was created was not created as
[114:53] an as a as a as a fetus. and then grew
[114:58] into a baby and or Venus is a baby. Let
[115:02] me back up. He he he was he wasn't he
[115:04] wasn't born. Adam was created fully
[115:08] formed and we don't know how old he was,
[115:11] how he looked, but we know how old he
[115:13] was on day one. He was one day old, but
[115:15] he looked probably like he was 30,
[115:18] right? Adam had all the things that a
[115:20] 30-year-old man would have. He had hair
[115:21] on his body. He had muscles on his
[115:24] flesh. He had all the things that a
[115:26] 30-year-old man would appear to have.
[115:28] And if a scientist looked at him on day
[115:31] one and they said, "You are 30 years
[115:33] old." He would say, "No, I'm one day old
[115:36] because that's the way I was created."
[115:39] And so when the world was created, uh I
[115:42] I think it's I think it's somewhat
[115:44] difficult to say, "Well, we're going to
[115:46] look at the evidence of history and and
[115:48] and determine how old the earth is."
[115:51] Because when we do it that way, we're
[115:53] we're we're looking at something that we
[115:55] can't really measure. We can't measure
[115:58] time and history. Uh we can we can make
[116:01] some assumptions
[116:03] based upon things like carbon dating and
[116:06] things like that which which can can be
[116:09] demonstrated to have erroneous results.
[116:13] But we can we we there's a different
[116:16] this is this is an area where I agree
[116:17] with Ken Ham. Kenham says there's a
[116:20] difference between observational science
[116:21] and historical science. Observational
[116:24] science says I'm going to test water
[116:26] boiling at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. I'm
[116:29] going to I'm going to test it and and
[116:30] it's going to boil at 212 degrees and
[116:33] it's going to do it every time that I do
[116:34] it. That is a repeatable I have a I have
[116:36] a experiment that I can do. I can repeat
[116:38] that experiment over and over and over
[116:40] and every time I do the experiment it
[116:42] shows me that water boils at 212
[116:43] degrees. What I can't do is I can't say
[116:46] for certain that a particular rock
[116:50] structure took 30,000 years to produce.
[116:54] Even though they'll say, well, we know
[116:55] that this because this is the amount of
[116:57] erosion that happens every year and this
[116:58] is how much erosion has been happening
[117:00] and therefore we know for sure this is
[117:02] how long this rock surface has been
[117:04] here, this rock structure. So something
[117:06] like the Grand Canyon or something like
[117:07] that. The problem with that is you can't
[117:12] you you you weren't there to examine the
[117:14] evidence as it was taking place. And I I
[117:17] like the Mount St. Helens argument. The
[117:19] the year I was born, Mount St. Helens
[117:21] erupted and it laid down a series of
[117:24] rock layers that in a in one afternoon
[117:30] it laid down what the natural processes
[117:32] of geological rock formation would have
[117:35] taken years to produce. But it happened
[117:37] in one afternoon. And so this is one of
[117:40] those times where when you when you ask
[117:42] the scientists and you say, "How old is
[117:45] something?" They're having to make some
[117:47] assumptions based upon what they see
[117:50] now. That's called historical science.
[117:52] That's looking at history and trying to
[117:54] make scientific determinations based
[117:56] upon what they can look at right now.
[117:59] Nobody can look a thousand years ago.
[118:00] Nobody can look 5,000 years ago. Nobody
[118:02] can look 10,000 years ago. um they can
[118:05] make assumptions about that. They can
[118:07] make scientific evaluations about that,
[118:09] but at the same time they can't know for
[118:12] certain and the one place that we do
[118:16] have certainty is from God's word. This
[118:18] again going back to Ken Ham, I do like
[118:20] what he says. He says there's one person
[118:21] who was there when the world was created
[118:23] and that's God. And so if we want to
[118:25] know how and when it was created, we go
[118:27] to God's word. Now God's word doesn't
[118:29] say that the earth is young. God's word
[118:31] simply says that God created the world
[118:33] in six days. And there are those who do
[118:35] believe that the days the young earth
[118:37] position that it can actually be
[118:39] expanded out and each one of those days
[118:40] could be longer periods of time. But the
[118:43] issue I take is when you start looking
[118:45] at the millions of years and billions of
[118:48] years, you realize how long a billion
[118:50] is.
[118:52] If you think of time in terms of
[118:55] seconds, a million seconds from now is
[118:59] 11 days from now. But a billion seconds
[119:02] from now is 30 years from now. Isn't
[119:06] that crazy? Just to think of the
[119:07] distinction between a million and a
[119:09] billion. So when we think about a
[119:12] billion years, the the the earth should
[119:14] be four and a half billion years old.
[119:15] The universe must be 13 billion years
[119:17] old. Then the the sheer numbers of that
[119:20] is astronomically just to me is out out
[119:23] of this world that I would consider that
[119:26] that would be accurate. Doesn't make
[119:28] sense to me. And it certainly doesn't
[119:29] line up with what I think the Bible
[119:30] teaches. Even if the Bible does give us
[119:32] an older earth, I don't think we're in
[119:34] the terms of billions of years. Uh uh
[119:36] that that that's again that's an opinion
[119:38] based on the text, but that's that's
[119:40] that's how I arrive at that. But the
[119:42] other issue and the major issue from a
[119:44] theological perspective is the issue of
[119:45] death. If you believe in
[119:50] sin bringing three things into the
[119:53] world, the Bible says sin brings three
[119:54] things. Death, disease, and destruction.
[119:57] Death, disease, and destruction came as
[119:59] a result of the fall. If you have death,
[120:02] disease, and destruction prior to the
[120:04] fall, then you have the consequences of
[120:06] sin without sin.
[120:09] And I think that's the biggest
[120:10] theological hurdle for me. And that's
[120:12] where I arrive at a young earth
[120:14] position. I don't believe that death,
[120:16] disease, and destruction were in the
[120:18] world prior to the fall. Now, you might
[120:21] say, "So, do you not think animals died
[120:23] before the fall?" Actually, I don't. But
[120:25] at the same time, I I I would hold that
[120:28] one a little less specific than I would
[120:30] say man. I say I don't believe man died
[120:33] prior to sin. In fact, I know that man
[120:35] did not die prior to sin. Um but I also
[120:38] don't believe animals did either. I
[120:40] believe animals were um were herbivore
[120:43] prior to the fall. I believe uh omnivore
[120:46] and carnivore was a result of what
[120:48] happened after the fall. Um, so that
[120:52] those are positions that are typical
[120:53] young earth positions, but um, but
[120:56] again, death, disease, and destruction
[120:58] prior to the fall, we we end up with a
[121:00] world that God created that was very
[121:01] good, but was filled with cancer. It was
[121:03] filled with with heart disease. It was
[121:06] filled with with with
[121:08] uh all kinds of other sicknesses, and
[121:11] that's all prior to the fall. I take a a
[121:13] big issue with that. So, that's how I
[121:15] arrived at my conclusion. And
[121:17] >> I agree with this, Scott. I think God
[121:18] planned painless child birth prefall.
[121:20] Sorry, ladies.
[121:21] >> Yeah. No, I agree. I I agree.
[121:25] Uh the master's call. Wait a minute. I
[121:27] got to respond to this. I don't know who
[121:29] this person is. It might be new to the
[121:31] channel and thank you for jumping in.
[121:33] But he says, "Adam was formed, not
[121:34] created." That's that.
[121:38] Are you saying that when something's
[121:39] formed, it's not created? that that I
[121:43] don't I don't understand the the nuance
[121:46] that you're trying to produce there. But
[121:48] to be honest with you, when God formed
[121:50] Adam, he was he created Adam. So I I
[121:53] don't see a distinction there or if if
[121:55] anything, it's a distinction without a
[121:56] difference. So um yeah. So again, I um
[122:03] I I I I think I guess I guess the
[122:05] argument that maybe that they're making
[122:07] that person was making was that Adam
[122:09] Adam came from a lower life form. Some
[122:11] people believe in in uh theistic
[122:13] evolution and say Adam Adam was taken
[122:16] from a a lower homminid and God gave him
[122:21] the imodi or the image of God and
[122:23] changed him. So uh yeah,
[122:26] >> look the this young man was on. Thank
[122:28] you so much for your insight. Your
[122:29] response was very beneficial to me.
[122:31] >> Great. Wonderful. Well, I'm glad I
[122:32] >> And I did catch this. I when we listened
[122:35] to it, I am a public school student, so
[122:37] current like a young man.
[122:38] >> Well, good.
[122:39] >> Like in public school.
[122:40] >> Good. Well,
[122:41] >> it's nice to see young young viewers.
[122:43] >> Yes. Always viewers are always happy.
[122:46] All right. Well, thank you for your
[122:48] question. I'm glad that was helpful.
[122:49] Let's move on. We've only got a couple
[122:50] questions left and uh we're going to try
[122:53] to finish out tonight.
[122:54] >> My question is about Bible reading.
[122:56] There are so many biblical resources out
[122:59] there, books, sermons, podcasts, etc.
[123:02] But sometimes I'm afraid I put more
[123:04] emphasis on these rather than on simply
[123:06] reading the Bible itself. Then of course
[123:09] there are just the everyday demands of
[123:10] life. I was raised in a legalistic you
[123:13] can be good enough for God environment
[123:15] and that put heavy emphasis on quiet
[123:17] times. So sometimes I can feel that
[123:19] pressure to just check it off the daily
[123:21] list. But I also want to be on guard
[123:24] against swinging the other way and
[123:26] living with a grace abounds mindset
[123:28] where which is really no need for that
[123:30] discipline. Also, I'm asking this
[123:33] question within the context of knowing
[123:35] that the Bible is where God's character
[123:37] is revealed and ultimately how we know
[123:39] we love him and what he is like. I tell
[123:42] my kids that neglecting God's word is
[123:44] like having a spouse who you love, but
[123:46] you never talk to them and live in
[123:48] complete silence. You have no idea what
[123:50] their character is like. what their
[123:52] interests are or what they expect from
[123:55] you. God has made known through his
[123:57] word. But since it would not be feasible
[123:59] to spend every waking hour reading it, I
[124:02] want to ask you, how much time should a
[124:04] Christian spend reading God's word every
[124:05] day?
[124:08] >> Honestly, great question, great subject.
[124:12] I will say this, uh you you mentioned
[124:15] there's so many biblical resources,
[124:17] books, sermons, podcasts, etc. But
[124:19] sometimes you're you're afraid you put
[124:20] more emphasis on that than simply
[124:21] reading the Bible. I think that that is
[124:24] that that's actually something that
[124:28] is is pretty common because it's easier
[124:32] to listen to a podcast or listen to a
[124:33] sermon than it is to actually read the
[124:35] Bible. Um because reading the Bible
[124:37] takes a certain amount of focus and uh
[124:39] you can just listen to a podcast and
[124:41] sort of let your mind you know uh just
[124:44] just go. I know there are people who
[124:46] tell me they listen to our podcast while
[124:47] cleaning their house or while working or
[124:49] driving their cars. And so it's not
[124:51] something you have to be totally engaged
[124:52] with. And and reading takes takes a
[124:55] certain amount of thought. It takes a
[124:58] certain amount of focus to actually sit
[125:00] and read what what what's in front of
[125:02] you. Um, and so yeah, there there is
[125:05] something that's that's more uh uh
[125:10] uh just more engaged with reading, I
[125:13] guess, is the point I'm making. But let
[125:15] me let me though say this. U how much
[125:19] time should a Christian spend reading
[125:21] God's word every day? There there's no
[125:24] answer to that that I can give because
[125:26] as soon as I give you an answer, what
[125:28] I've done is I've set for you some kind
[125:30] of a legalistic standard for you to
[125:31] meet.
[125:33] Instead of telling you you should read
[125:34] your Bible 10 minutes a day, you should
[125:36] read your Bible 20 minutes a day, or you
[125:38] should read three chapters a day because
[125:39] if you read three chapters a day, you'll
[125:40] read the whole Bible in a year or
[125:42] something like that. Rather than giving
[125:43] you an arbitrary standard, what I'd
[125:45] rather say is there are three ways to
[125:48] read the Bible, and you need to decide
[125:51] what way you're going to try to read it
[125:53] and and and and understand why you're
[125:56] doing it. The first way that you read
[125:59] the Bible is what's known as devotional
[126:01] reading. And that's where you're simply
[126:02] reading the Bible and you're not seeking
[126:05] necessarily to interpret it. You're not
[126:07] seeking necessarily to execute it.
[126:09] You're just reading it and you're uh
[126:12] taking in what you understand from that
[126:14] passage and seeking to make some type of
[126:17] an application and you're you're you're
[126:19] you're just getting you're just getting
[126:21] the word of God into you. And that's
[126:23] good. That's a good thing to do.
[126:25] Devotional reading. And if you did that
[126:27] every day, it would be helpful to you.
[126:28] The Bible says, "Thy word I've hid in my
[126:30] heart that I may not sin against you."
[126:31] So, devotional reading is good. You're
[126:32] just getting it into you, right? And it
[126:34] and and and you're not arguing or
[126:36] wrestling with the word. You're not
[126:38] you're not you're not you uh necessarily
[126:41] seeking exesus or interpretation. You're
[126:43] just reading the word, getting the word
[126:45] of God into you. That's good. The second
[126:48] way that you can read the word is by
[126:52] seeking to uh to dive deeply into the
[126:55] word and try to to to parse and to
[126:57] nuance and to understand what the text
[126:59] is saying. And that is more of a deeper
[127:02] of a study. And I don't expect that you
[127:04] would do that every single day. Uh and
[127:07] unless that's what you're planning to do
[127:09] for a certain period of time over a
[127:11] certain particular passage or a certain
[127:12] particular book, right? And so you may
[127:15] change from doing devotional reading for
[127:16] a couple of months to then doing a a a
[127:19] good strong study of the the Gospel of
[127:22] Matthew for 30 days or something like
[127:24] that, right? There might be a change.
[127:26] And so changing up how you read might be
[127:29] good. And then of course there's times
[127:31] where you might want to devote yourself
[127:33] to the memorizing of scripture. I
[127:34] already said that one passage, the um
[127:36] thy word I've hid in my heart that I may
[127:38] not sin against you. So my my question
[127:40] to you back to you would be what are you
[127:43] hoping to accomplish? Are you just
[127:44] wanting to get the scripture into you?
[127:46] Are you wanting to better understand a
[127:47] certain section of scripture? Or are you
[127:49] wanting to memorize and have at your
[127:53] disposal much of scripture through memor
[127:56] memorizing the text? And so those are
[127:58] different ways and different focuses
[128:00] that you can have while you're reading
[128:02] the scripture. But all of those are just
[128:05] I can't say read 10 minutes a day and
[128:06] that's your goal. Read 20 minutes a day,
[128:08] that's your goal. Read three chapters a
[128:10] day and that's your goal. Because I'm I
[128:12] I can't give you an arbitrary standard
[128:14] like that because all I do when I do
[128:15] that is set a legalistic standard.
[128:18] Here's something I will tell you about
[128:19] my own personal Bible reading, my own
[128:22] personal uh uh investment in the word is
[128:27] I I am more the second type. I am I'm
[128:29] I'm studying for a purpose. I want to
[128:32] know what the word says about a
[128:33] particular thing. And so even though I
[128:36] do have a regular routine of reading
[128:38] through scripture devotionally, I'm
[128:40] almost always on the other side also
[128:42] doing some intentional exposition.
[128:45] Sometimes it's for the sermons that I'm
[128:46] teaching, sometimes it's for articles or
[128:48] things that I'm writing, and sometimes
[128:50] it's just because I want to know about
[128:51] something. And so uh that's the way I
[128:54] keep myself invested in the word is by
[128:56] diving into these subjects and trying to
[128:58] learn as much as I can about a
[129:00] particular passage or a particular book
[129:02] or a particular subject in the
[129:04] scripture. So just remember there's not
[129:06] one way to read the Bible and there's
[129:08] not one standard for how long you should
[129:09] read the Bible every day. But just if
[129:11] God is the passion of your heart and the
[129:13] desire of your heart, seek him in every
[129:15] way that you can. And if you use
[129:16] podcasts and sermons to build that up,
[129:18] that's great. But the source is always
[129:20] going to be the word of God. Can I read
[129:22] something real quick? Yeah.
[129:23] >> Just real fast. Um, this is I was
[129:25] talking to my Sunday school class about
[129:27] resolutions. And Jonathan um Edwards,
[129:30] one of his resolutions was resolved to
[129:33] study the scripture so steadily,
[129:34] constantly, and frequently as that I may
[129:37] find and plainly perceive myself to grow
[129:39] in the knowledge of the same. So, it's
[129:41] not like a certain amount or certain
[129:42] number just are you growing, but all of
[129:44] those things like you mentioned are are
[129:47] going to do that.
[129:49] >> Yep. Uh, I I I like this one. Fast Daddy
[129:52] put, "I was about to mention the
[129:54] difference between devotional and deep
[129:55] study. Do you find it hard to switch
[129:56] between the two?" Not not not normally.
[130:00] Great question, Fast, but because
[130:01] normally my if I if I'm doing
[130:03] devotionals say like Jennifer and I, we
[130:05] we didn't do it much this year, but but
[130:07] in years past, we've like read the same
[130:09] passages every day. Like we have a Bible
[130:11] app that we use that we try to read the
[130:13] same one. This year we're switching to
[130:14] the yearly Bible app, which is the one
[130:16] from uh uh the Martin Chamberlain who
[130:19] put put out Tiny Bibles. He has the
[130:21] yearly Bible app. And this year we're
[130:23] using that one uh to begin our
[130:25] devotional reading. And so that way we
[130:27] have the same we're reading the same
[130:28] thing every day, but that's not what I'm
[130:30] studying. That's just what I'm doing to
[130:31] get the Bible into me. Uh the actual one
[130:34] that I'm studying usually is something
[130:36] different and it's focused on something
[130:38] else. So I'm able to separate the two
[130:40] because I keep them both sort of
[130:42] categorized in my brain. But when I am
[130:45] reading through, I tell you what,
[130:48] stuff comes up that I'm like, ah, I got
[130:50] to look deeper into that because that's
[130:52] >> squirrel.
[130:53] >> Yeah, for sure.
[130:55] >> All right, guys. Uh,
[130:58] let's do these last three.
[131:01] I'm I'm going to help out. I'm going to
[131:02] jump in here. Okay. Uh, uh, we're at
[131:05] 21:05.
[131:06] This next question, it's long. I'm just
[131:09] going to summarize it. Where does a
[131:11] discerning Christian draw the line as it
[131:13] pertains to conservative Christian
[131:14] media? The person asking the question is
[131:16] asking um what about guys who are
[131:21] conservative in their positions, but
[131:23] they're going into places that you don't
[131:25] agree with. And he mentions a few names
[131:27] here. I'm not going to I'm not going to
[131:29] name not because I'm afraid of naming
[131:31] names, but I just don't want to get into
[131:33] uh some of this some of the areas that
[131:35] this would take take me tonight. But
[131:36] basically, the question is
[131:40] um where do you draw the line? Where do
[131:43] you draw the line uh when it comes to
[131:47] who you listen to in the in in Christian
[131:50] conservative circles? Because here's the
[131:54] thing, things have gotten weird in the
[131:58] online
[132:00] uh sort of atmosphere. Uh uh the the
[132:04] especially the Christian online
[132:05] atmosphere. There's a lot of weird stuff
[132:06] that goes on. And as I said in my I I
[132:09] mentioned this earlier when I was at
[132:10] Michael Foster's church this year,
[132:11] somebody asked, "How do we how do we not
[132:15] how do we uh fight against the crazy
[132:19] things that are happening online?" And I
[132:21] said, 'D don't feed the stupid. And I
[132:23] and I'm going to keep saying that.
[132:24] >> We should put that on a shirt.
[132:26] >> Don't feed the stupid.
[132:28] >> Don't feed the stupid. Meaning, if you
[132:29] know that there are guys out there that
[132:31] are teaching things that are just not
[132:32] right or teaching things that are weird
[132:34] or teaching things that are are stupid,
[132:36] don't go there. Don't encourage people
[132:39] to go there. And when you see those
[132:41] guys, don't share their stuff. Don't
[132:43] quote their stuff. Don't endorse their
[132:45] stuff. Just ignore it. Just leave it
[132:48] alone. Don't feed the stupid. The only
[132:51] thing that keeps these guys going is the
[132:53] attention that they're given. And so
[132:56] that that that's one thing. Um the
[132:59] second thing is where do you draw the
[133:00] line? I mean there are guys that I
[133:03] disagree with about some stuff, some
[133:04] pretty serious stuff, but I still think
[133:06] that they're Christians, right? But
[133:08] there are other guys that when I see
[133:10] them and I and I see their behavior,
[133:12] hold on.
[133:14] >> Bless you. and I see their behavior and
[133:16] I see what they're saying and I see
[133:18] their lifestyle,
[133:20] the way they portray themselves, I'm
[133:22] like, I just don't want anything to do
[133:23] with those guys. And this is this this
[133:25] is a big part of what discernment is.
[133:27] Discernment is not knowing the
[133:29] difference between right and wrong, but
[133:30] as Spurgeon said, uh, knowing the
[133:32] difference between right and almost
[133:33] right, right? There's some guys out
[133:35] there who are almost right, but they're
[133:36] just wrong enough to be dangerous. And
[133:39] so, you got to be careful. You got to
[133:41] watch out for those guys. You got to say
[133:42] to yourself, do I really want to do is
[133:46] it worth listening to this guy? Is there
[133:48] not a better guy? Right? Is this really
[133:51] the best we have? Right? Is this is
[133:54] there not better people to teach me? And
[133:57] uh one of the one of the really good
[133:59] things that you can do is actually start
[134:02] to listen to people from the past.
[134:06] Like start listening to read some of the
[134:09] Puritans. start listening to pastors
[134:11] from 30, 50, 100, 200 years ago. Like,
[134:14] how can you listen to them? We had to
[134:15] read them because they didn't have
[134:17] audios. Uh
[134:18] >> audio has someone read.
[134:20] >> Yeah. Some of that you can listen to.
[134:21] Yeah. And there's uh um my friend uh who
[134:25] has the uh Revived Thoughts, the Revived
[134:29] Thoughts podcast. I've read some of the
[134:31] sermons for him. He takes sermons from
[134:33] people like John John Calvin and others,
[134:36] puts their information out there. Um,
[134:38] and so go and do that and and and
[134:43] the question of how do you draw the line
[134:47] truth? If there's somebody out there who
[134:50] is perpetuating error or perpetuating
[134:53] the questions like, well, I'm not saying
[134:55] it, but I'm I'm just throwing out the
[134:58] question and it's something that is
[135:00] wildly misinformed or dangerous. that
[135:04] person is probably not worth you
[135:06] devoting your time to listening to.
[135:08] There's so much out there to listen to
[135:09] and so many people to listen to. You
[135:11] don't need to feed the stupid. And I'll
[135:14] leave it.
[135:14] >> That's right, Jessica. We need shirts.
[135:16] Don't feed the stupid.
[135:17] >> Yep. I'm going to do it. Don't feed the
[135:19] stupid. All right.
[135:22] >> Okay.
[135:24] >> 215 and 25.
[135:28] >> I have a question about how a husband
[135:30] and wife should be working together to
[135:32] shepherd their children.
[135:33] All right. Okay. That this is a long
[135:35] question, but basically
[135:40] >> I I I hate because we're so close to the
[135:41] end. I feel like we're we're we're going
[135:43] to have to to to kind of give this a
[135:46] short answer, but we talked a lot about
[135:48] this one in the car to the person who
[135:50] wrote this question in the the the
[135:52] basically, let me summarize. You've got
[135:53] a a husband and wife who have struggled
[135:57] with his spiritual leadership, who have
[135:58] struggled with her spiritual submission
[136:00] to him. He has had some errors in the
[136:02] past. She has had some errors in the
[136:04] past. They're both recognizing their
[136:05] errors and now they're trying to figure
[136:07] out how to work through the struggles of
[136:10] the past and how to actually come to a
[136:12] right understanding of her position as
[136:14] submitting to him and his position as
[136:16] leading her. Am I am I that's right
[136:18] getting that pretty well?
[136:19] >> And ultimately,
[136:21] what are they supposed to be doing? And
[136:24] I I I think maybe I could read this
[136:27] part. Um um neither of us has a firm
[136:30] grasp on which roles are whose. And I
[136:32] feel like it's leading to absolute chaos
[136:34] in our parenting. I overstep and he
[136:36] overreacts. He hesitates and I
[136:38] overreact. I want to create the space he
[136:40] needs to lead our family, but I'm afraid
[136:41] to completely leave our kids in the dark
[136:43] while he finds his way there. How do we
[136:45] navigate that? If you have any resources
[136:48] on the matter, we would love to have
[136:49] something to study together. Thank you
[136:50] for your faithfulness. I've really
[136:52] enjoyed your podcast since I found you a
[136:54] few months ago. Thank you for all that.
[136:56] Let me let me say this. Number one, I'll
[136:59] give you the resources. I do think that
[137:01] this is something Jennifer and I use
[137:03] when we're counseling uh husbands and
[137:04] wives. We counsel couples. Uh the
[137:06] exemplary husband by Stuart,
[137:10] what's his last name?
[137:12] >> I'll find it.
[137:12] >> It's Stuart. I think it's Scott. Uh the
[137:15] exemplary husband and the extra uh uh
[137:17] extraordinary wife.
[137:18] >> Excellent.
[137:19] >> Excellent wife by Martha Peace. Right.
[137:22] >> Those are two books if you have not read
[137:23] them. Uh they're they're complimentary
[137:26] books and they're good for for him and
[137:29] for you. And so I would uh I would
[137:33] definitely go and and check those out.
[137:35] Um
[137:37] >> Stuart Scott.
[137:38] >> Stuart Scott. That's I was going to say
[137:39] Steuart Scott. Why didn't I just say it?
[137:41] Yeah. Okay. All right. You know, I was
[137:42] thinking Steuart Smallley.
[137:44] >> He's a Gary Small.
[137:45] >> Gary Smallley. Yeah, I was thinking of
[137:46] that. But um but but that that's the
[137:49] recommendation I would give you. But but
[137:51] here's something else I would say. Um,
[137:53] as I read your email and I was thinking
[137:55] through the the problems that you re
[137:57] that you that you were saying here
[137:59] here's here's my my my my thought.
[138:01] Number one,
[138:03] there's there's two passages of
[138:05] scripture that I want you to really
[138:07] spend your time
[138:10] meditating on. One, um, for you the
[138:15] wife, I I want you to spend some time
[138:18] really thinking about Hey, Watchwell
[138:21] just came into the chat. Uh, Parker, the
[138:24] fetus is out there
[138:25] >> at 11:18.
[138:26] >> 11:118. Yeah, we're almost finished. Uh,
[138:30] I really want you, the wife, to consider
[138:33] what it means to respect your husband.
[138:35] And I really want your husband to
[138:36] consider what it means to live with you
[138:37] in an understanding way. We're told in
[138:40] scripture that a husband is to live with
[138:42] his wife in an understanding way so that
[138:44] his prayers would not be hindered. What
[138:46] does it mean to live in an understanding
[138:48] way? Well, that's what it means to love.
[138:50] Because a husband is to love his wife as
[138:52] Christ loved the church. And the wife is
[138:54] to respect her husband, submit to her
[138:55] husband. Um, are you submitting to your
[138:58] husband or are you only submitting to
[138:59] yourself? I've told this story before. I
[139:02] think it's I think it's a good a good
[139:04] illustration. And if you haven't heard
[139:06] it, I I'll make it quick.
[139:08] A um a father called his son into his
[139:12] office and he said uh he said, "Son, I
[139:15] I'm I'm trying to get everything
[139:17] prepared. I know that my life is short
[139:19] and I want to get some things prepared.
[139:21] So, I'm going to give you I want I want
[139:23] you to take some money out of our
[139:24] account. They were in business together.
[139:25] I want you to take some money out of our
[139:26] account and set up a trust fund for your
[139:28] kids. And the son said, "I agree with
[139:30] that. That's a great idea." And he did
[139:32] it. Couple weeks later, the father
[139:33] brought him in. He said, "Hey, we've got
[139:35] we've got some stocks we need to sell. I
[139:37] want you to sell some of that stock. Put
[139:38] that money into an account for your
[139:40] mother so that when something happens to
[139:41] me, your mother's taken care of." And
[139:43] the son says, "I agree with that, Dad.
[139:44] Let's do that." And he did it. and he
[139:46] actually set up the account for the mom.
[139:48] Well, couple weeks go by and the father
[139:50] called the son in again and he says,
[139:51] "You know, son, we we have this
[139:53] investment property and it's not really
[139:55] doing much and I I think I want to sell
[139:56] that investment property." And the son
[139:58] goes, "Oh, dad, I really don't think we
[139:59] should. I've been looking forward to
[140:00] having that property." And the father
[140:02] says, "Well, it's my property. I I I
[140:04] want you to go ahead and sell it." And
[140:05] the son didn't sell it. He just chose
[140:09] not to. Now the question is how many
[140:12] times did the son submit to his father?
[140:15] Most people would say he submitted to
[140:17] the father twice. But the answer is he
[140:20] submitted to the father zero times. Why
[140:22] do I say he submitted to the father zero
[140:24] times? Because he only did what he
[140:27] agreed to. And when you only do what you
[140:30] you agreed to, then you're not
[140:31] submitting to the other person. Right?
[140:35] The first time it was take out some
[140:36] money and give it to your kids. I agree
[140:38] to that, so I'll do it. The second one
[140:39] was take some money out and give it to
[140:41] your mother. I agree to that. Third
[140:43] time, sell the property. I don't want to
[140:45] sell the property. I'm not going to do
[140:46] it. If he didn't want to do the other
[140:47] two things, he wouldn't have done those
[140:49] either because he wasn't in submission
[140:51] to the father. He wasn't in submission
[140:54] to his father. So, I step back and I
[140:55] say, when the Bible calls a wife to
[140:57] submit to her husband, it's not just do
[140:59] what you agree to. It's actually listen
[141:02] to the leadership of your husband. You
[141:04] say, "Well, I don't trust him right now.
[141:05] I'm struggling with trusting him because
[141:06] he wasn't a good leader for a while."
[141:08] Okay, I understand that. That's why he
[141:10] is the one with the bigger
[141:12] responsibility because his
[141:14] responsibility is to lead you well. So I
[141:16] would say this to him. You have a
[141:17] responsibility to live with your wife in
[141:19] an understanding way to love her as
[141:20] Christ loved the church and to lead her
[141:23] as the spiritual leader of the home. You
[141:24] have a big responsibility. But that
[141:26] responsibility given to him doesn't
[141:29] change your responsibility to submit to
[141:30] him in every area. The Bible says to
[141:32] submit to him in all things. So my
[141:35] encouragement to you is to recognize
[141:37] those two things. It's hard. It's not
[141:39] easy. But you know what? Those two areas
[141:43] are probably the areas you're fighting
[141:44] the most. You don't want to submit to
[141:46] him and he doesn't want to live with you
[141:48] in an understanding way. So my two
[141:50] encouragement to you is to look at those
[141:51] passages. Get those books we mentioned
[141:53] and um if you have a pastor in your life
[141:56] and I pray that you do maybe seek out
[141:59] someone a third party him your pastor or
[142:01] someone else in the church who can offer
[142:03] up a counseling for the two of you to
[142:05] help you to grow together and get back
[142:08] on the on the place where you need to be
[142:10] because you said you were there at one
[142:12] time and you've grown away from that. I
[142:14] pray that you would get back to it. All
[142:16] right, last one and we are going to be
[142:18] done.
[142:20] >> Okay. I'm in a bit of a tough situation
[142:22] with my church. It's not a reformed
[142:25] church, although many of the pastors are
[142:27] Calvinistic, and they play songs by
[142:29] Bethl, Elevation, and Hill Song, who I'm
[142:32] sure you're aware all come from
[142:34] movements that promote false teaching.
[142:36] I'm part of the worship team at my
[142:38] church and I've recently told the
[142:39] worship leader that I no longer feel
[142:41] comfortable playing songs by those
[142:42] groups as it feels like we're promoting
[142:44] the churches that play these songs. I'm
[142:47] planning on meeting with him in person
[142:49] as well as my pastor to discuss my
[142:50] concerns more. I have a good idea that
[142:53] I'm going to ask them, but I'm
[142:55] interested in hearing your thought
[142:56] opinion on what I should ask them. If
[142:59] they refuse to stop playing songs by
[143:01] these groups, should I leave the church?
[143:03] I have a great church family there and
[143:05] our doctrine is very sound and biblical,
[143:08] but I'm just not sure if I can continue
[143:09] to go to a church that promotes these
[143:11] groups.
[143:12] >> Okay. Um,
[143:15] this is an area where I I I sort of have
[143:20] mixed opinions and not not that not not
[143:24] that I'm mixed on Bethl or Elevation or
[143:26] Hill Song. I think they're all garbage
[143:28] and I think their teaching is bad and I
[143:30] don't think it should be promoted and I
[143:31] don't think it should be sung in
[143:32] churches and we try not to sing those
[143:34] songs at sovereign grace. When I say we
[143:35] try not to I'm I'm sure at times maybe
[143:37] one or two has made its way in so I
[143:40] don't want to say we've never done it
[143:41] but we certainly don't try to do it. Can
[143:44] we can you repeat the question? No, we
[143:45] cannot. Uh but thank you for asking. Um
[143:50] but here here's the thing. uh
[143:55] you you were a part of the worship team
[143:56] and you stepped down because you didn't
[143:58] want to continue to to to play these
[144:01] songs and I I I think that's the best
[144:03] thing to do if it's bothering your
[144:05] conscience. But I really struggle with
[144:06] someone leaving a church over this
[144:09] unless the unless the songs are
[144:11] specifically theologically in error.
[144:14] That's where I think it would be a real
[144:16] issue for me. Um, I understanding who
[144:20] wrote a song and and where the song came
[144:22] from, that can be bad and I do think it
[144:24] is bad and I don't think it should be
[144:26] promoted. But at the same time, if I'm
[144:29] in a loving church that's preaching the
[144:31] gospel and seeking to do everything
[144:32] right and this is the one area that
[144:34] they're failing in, I don't think that I
[144:36] would allow that to let me leave.
[144:39] I think I would have a conversation with
[144:41] my elder and I think that's what you
[144:42] said you want to do. And the
[144:43] conversation would begin basically
[144:46] basically with this. It would need to
[144:47] start this way. Elder, pastor, whoever
[144:50] it is you're talking to, I want you to
[144:51] know that I love you and I'm not being
[144:53] accusatory. I'm not trying to create
[144:54] division and I'm not trying to sew
[144:56] dissension among the body. But I do have
[144:58] a question.
[145:00] Why is it that we think that it's good
[145:01] to promote these bands? Why is it that
[145:04] we can't find better songs and better
[145:07] bands and better music to choose from?
[145:09] because so many of these bands are
[145:12] promoting a false gospel even if the
[145:14] music they they write has some good
[145:16] lyrics and just see what they say. They
[145:18] might say, "You know what? It's not a
[145:20] big deal. We just don't think it's a big
[145:21] deal." And at that point, you can maybe
[145:24] express that to you, you feel like it is
[145:26] a big deal. But at the same time, I
[145:29] really would have a hard time if you're
[145:30] in a church that loves you, loves your
[145:33] family, and is preaching the gospel. I
[145:35] don't think I would walk out over this.
[145:39] But I would have this conversation. So
[145:41] my recommendation is have the
[145:42] conversation and begin with that. What
[145:44] is it? Why are we doing this? And is
[145:46] there not a better way? Is there not a
[145:48] better way? And and and again go to them
[145:50] in the heart of love and the heart of
[145:52] saying I'm not here to create division
[145:54] or dissension. I'm not here to sew
[145:56] discord. I really am here to hopefully
[145:59] try to to help you understand my heart
[146:01] on this. And um and so that's that's the
[146:05] way I would I would go. I would go
[146:07] remember this. Proverbs 15:1
[146:10] says, "A soft word turns away wrath, but
[146:13] a harsh word stirs up division." So if
[146:17] you go and you go with a harsh word, why
[146:20] are you so dumb to be playing Bethl
[146:22] songs? Don't you know how dangerous that
[146:23] is? That's going to create division.
[146:25] That's going to create dissension. But
[146:26] if you go in and you say, I just have a
[146:28] question. Why do we think this is a good
[146:30] idea? And is there not a better way?
[146:33] That would be the way I would approach
[146:34] it. And so that's that's my thought.
[146:38] Guys, I think that's going to be where
[146:39] we end tonight. Did was there something
[146:41] else you wanted to mention?
[146:44] >> Uh, Cap says, "Happy New Year, y'all.
[146:46] Stay safe and blessed."
[146:48] >> # don't feed the stupid. That's going to
[146:50] be the hashtag for January. The hashtag
[146:53] for January.
[146:54] >> Before you leave, let's pray for him
[146:56] because he says he might have the flu or
[146:58] cold.
[146:58] >> All right, let's do that. And and uh and
[147:02] we'll close out with a prayer. All
[147:04] right. Father, we thank you for this
[147:07] opportunity. It's been a long two and a
[147:08] half hours, Lord. My eyes are getting
[147:10] heavy, but I'm thankful to get to talk
[147:12] about your word. I'm thankful to get to
[147:13] talk to your people, and I'm thankful to
[147:15] get to minister alongside my wife. And I
[147:17] pray, Lord, that this has been a
[147:18] blessing to those who have listened to
[147:20] it. And I pray pray especially for Jim,
[147:22] Lord, that you would raise him up, keep
[147:24] him from being too sick, Lord, and even
[147:26] grant him healing in accordance with
[147:27] your will, that he might be able to be
[147:30] uh be able to enjoy his new year and and
[147:33] not be under the weather. And father, we
[147:35] thank you for him being a a consistent
[147:39] uh person in our audience and a
[147:40] consistent part of our chat group. And
[147:42] we just pray that you bless him and
[147:44] continue to strengthen him as well as
[147:46] all the others, Lord, who are listening.
[147:47] Lord, be with them till we meet again.
[147:49] We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[147:52] >> Amen.
[147:52] >> All right, guys. Thank you so much.
[147:54] Happy New Year. We will see you
[147:56] >> next year.
[147:57] >> May God bless you all and good night.
[148:01] >> Good night.
[148:04] Sometimes I feel the weight of the world
[148:08] fall down on me
[148:12] and I need a friendly voice with some
[148:15] good theology.
[148:19] So I mix a manly drink.
[148:22] Then I hit the YouTube link
[148:26] and I feel my troubles all melt away.
